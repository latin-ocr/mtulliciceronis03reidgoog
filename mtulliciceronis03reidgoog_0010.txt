vi ¹ PREFACE.

Ι been so written, the work os Zeller iar transcends the rest in
importance sor such studies as those with which I have been
here concerned.

Some illustrative matter which Ι had intended to include in
the notes hasbeen abandoned from want os space. In particular
I hoped to indicate throughout the work the relation in which
the doctrines discussed in the Academica stand to similar
doctrines put sorward in modern times. Ι trust that it may be
possible for me to deal with this subject in aseparate publica·
tion at sorne future time.

The scantiness os my leisure has prevented me from passing
'the work rapldly through the press3 hence some irregularities

and changes of plan have crept in sor which 1 owe an apology to χ

the reader. Sorne ol' these are mentioned in the “Addenda and
Corrigenda” The index hasbeen prepared with special care, and
Ι hope it will render the book useful in some degree as a work

ol reference. The plan oi writing the critical notes in Latin is ,

so obviously convenient and has been so extensively adopted
that it nceds no apology.
