ADDENDA ANB commemor. ix

11516, n. on incognita. In Plin. n. h. ιο, tao condita is prob. a
corruption oi cognita.

· 521, p. 000. In the lirst line oi the first column oi the nm, ior

596 read 5 95.

5 03, ιι. on quibus solis. Hinel 3, 077 bases an argument on the notion
that quidus=uirtutibus.

,,, n· on artem uiuendi. Hirzel, 3, 079 ιι. implies that this defini·
tion was distinctively Antiocheam which is not the case.

⁴ 507, a. on proditur. In the last line, ior libri read uiri; see
5 rot, n. on Epicuri capite.

5a9 duo haec maxima. Hirzel 3, 077 argues that Antiochus
must have differed from the Stoics in giving protasi aposition
subordinate to ethics. Surely the later Stoics, at least, agreed
herein with Ant.

530, n. on lucem eripere. At the beginning ot' the n. insert ‘so
5 ιο5,’ and in the 4th line lor5 ¹⁰9 read 5 ¹03·

531, n. on dicemus. In the seventh line stom the bottom‚ lor 1,
46 n. read ι,44 ιι.

535. Hirzel 3, 054 ιι. proposes to eject as gloss all from ex hoc
to nola, on the ground that the argumentis disturbed. But he
forces ex hoc to mean ‘as a logical inierence from this’ which
is quite unnecessary, and he iails to see that the words scd...
nata imply (though they do not state) that the sceptic regards
probability as his justification lor making statements (ci. 5 30).
Hence the question quod est etc. is quite natural.

539, cr. nn. For ι4 read 15and in n. on l 19, ior B. read Bait.
„ 1. 14. For quas perhaps we should read quasi5 cf. 5 30
probabile et quasi ueri simile, and many other things oi the kind.

540. Hirzel 3, 056 ιιι, 064 raises many difficulties (imaginary,
as they seem to me) regarding the development oi the argument.
Some oi them rest on a misconception oi cotnra, which does not
mean ‘in answer to' but ⁴ on the opposite side’ (ci. r 5 ι3).

5 43, ιι. on subtilitatem. For 1, 6 read r, 7.

5 47 Hirzcl 3, 060 ιι. has a long mistaken argument, based on a
misunderstanding oi the phrase salsa uisa, which merely means
‘impressimus not proceeding from solid realities’ and not ’ἰηι-
pressione portending untruly’ (with reference to μαντική etc).

550, p. 038. ln l. 7 ol the first column ol the nm, ior 5 ¹³3 read
read5132.

571 cum quaereret: iterative subja hence the change oi mood irorn
placebat.

5 palestine. Pluygers, Mnemosyne tx conj. festinanter, needlessly.
Cf. Dima, 35 quam festiue dissoluitur (os a logical difficulty);
ib. 107 festiue et breuiter (oi an argumentative statement).

5 96. 1 think it highly probable that Cic. wrote inutiliosiun cs. 0
