2 THE Α CADEMJCS OF CICERO.

At this time (1.0. before 88 ac) Cicero also heard the lectures of
¹ Diodotus the Stoic, with whom he studied chiefly, though not exclu-

sively‚ the art 01 (1101001101. This art, which Cicero deems so important ¹

to the orator that he calls it ‘abbreviated eloquence‚’ was then almost
the monopoly of the Stoic school For some time Cicero spent all his
days with Diodotus in the severest study, buthe seems not to have been
much attracted by the general Stoic teaching. Stin, the friendship
between the two lasted till the death of Diodotus, who, according to a
fashion set by the Roman Stoic circle of the tirne of Scipio and Laelius,

became an inmate of Cicero's house, where he died 111110. 59, leaving η

his pupil heir toa not inconsiderable property¹. He seems to have
been' one 01 the most accompiished men 01 his time, and Cicero’s
feelings towards him were those 01 gratitude, esteem,and-ad1nira-
ti0n⁸.
¹ In the year 88 nc. the celebrated Philo 01 Larissa, then head 01 the
Academic School, 001110 10 Rome, one of a number 01 eminent Greeks
who fied 110111 Athens on the approach 01 its siege during the Mithri-

datic war. Philo, like Diodotus, was a man 01 versatile genius: unlike 1
the Stoic philosopher, he was a perfect master 01 both the theory and r
the practice of oratory. Cicero had scarcely heard him before all .

inclination 101 Epicureanism was swept from his mind, and he sur·
rendered himself wholly, as he tells us, to the brilliant Academic⁴.
Smitten with a marvellous enthusiasm he abandoned all other studies
101 philosophy. His zeal was quickened by the conviction that the
old judicial system 01 Rome was overthrown for ever, and that the
’ great career once open to an orator was now barred⁸.

We thus see that before Cicero was twenty years 01 age, he had
been brought into intimate connexion with at least three of the most
eminent philosophers of the day, who represented the three most
vigorous and important Greek schools. It is 1011 10 conclude that
he -must have become thoroughly acquainted with their spirit, and
with the main tenets of each. His own statements, after every deduc-
tion necessitated by his egotism has been made, leave no doubt about
his diligence ‘as 0 student. In his later works he osten dwells on his
,youthful devotion to philosophy⁸. It would be unwise to lay too
