INTRODUCTION 3

much stress on the close relation which subsisted between the rhetorical “

and the ethieal teaching of the Greeks, but there can be little doubt -
that from the great rhetorician Molo, at this time Rhodiam ambassador
at Rome, Cicero gained valuable information concerning the ethical
part of the Greek philosophy.

During the years 88-81 rac. Cicero employed himself incessantly
with the pursuit of philosophy, law, rhetoric, arrd belles lettres. Many
ambitious works in the two departments last mentioned were written by ,
him at this period On Sulla's return to the city after his conquest
of the Marian party in Italy, judicia] affairs once more took their
regular course, and Cicero appeared as a pleader in the courts, the one
philosophie orator of Rome, as he not unjustly boasts¹. For two years
he was busily engaged, and then suddenly left Rome for a tour in
Eastern Hellas. It is usually supposed thathe came into collision
with Sulla through the freedman Chrysogonus, who was implicated ¹
in the case of Roscius.. The silence of Cicero isenough to condemn
this theory, which rests on no better evidence than that of Plutarch.
Cicero himself, even when mentioning his speech in defenee of Roscius,
never assigns any other cause for his departure than his health, which
was being undermined by his passionate style of oratory'.

The whole two years 79-77 a c. were spent in the society of Greek
philosophers and rhetoricians. The first six months were passed at
Athens, and were almost entirely devoted to philosophy, since, with the
exception of Demetrius Syrus, there were no eminent rhetorical teachers
at that time resident in the city³. Probably by the advice of Philo
himself ⁴, Cicero attended the lectures of that clear thinker and writer, as
Diogenes Laertius calls him⁵, Zeno of Sidon, now the coryphaeus (so
Philo entitled him) of the Epicurean school. In Cicero's later works
· there are several references to his teaching. He was biting and sarcastic
in speech, and spiteful in spirit, hence in striking contrast to Patro and
Phaedrus⁸. Itis curious to find that Zeno is numbered by Cicero
among those pupils and admirers of Carneades whom he had known'.
Phaedrus was now at Athens, and along with Atticus, who loved Phae-
drus beyond all other philosophers⁸, Cicero spent much time in listening
to his instruction, which was eagerly discussed by the two pupils⁰.
Patro was probably in ¹Athens at the same time, but this is nowhere
