4 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

explicitly stated Cicero must at this period have atained an almost
complete familiarity with the Epicurean doctrines

There seems to have been no eminent representative of the Stoic
school then living at Athens. Nor is any mention made ol a Peripatetic
teacher whose lectures Cicero might have attended, though M. Pupius
Piso, a prolessed Peripatetic, wasone os his companions in this sojoum
at Athens¹. Only three notable Peripatetics were at this time living. χ

Of these Staseas of Naples, who lived some time in Piso's house, was

not then at Athens'3 it is probable‚ however, from a mention os him ἶ

in the De Oratore, that Cicero knew him through Piso. Diodorus,

the pupil of Critolaus, is frequently named by Cicero, but never as ,

an acquaintance. Cratippus was at this time unknown to him.

The philosopher from whose lessons Cicero certainly learned most
at this period was Antiochus of Ascalon, now the representative of
aStoicised Academia school. Os this teacher, however, l shall have
to treat later, when I shall attempt to estimate the influence he exer·
cised over our author. Itis sufficient here to say that on the main
Ι point which was in controversy between Philo and Antiochus, Cicero
still continued to think with his earlier teacher. His later works‚
however, make it evident that he set a high value on the-abilities and
· the learning of Antiochus, especially in dialectic‚ which was taught by
him alter Stoic principles. Cicero speaks of him as eminent among
the philosophers os the time, both sor talent and acquirement'3 as a
man of acute intellect‘3 as possessed oi a pointed style⁵3 in fine,

as the most cultivated and keenest philosopher of the age⁸. A con· ’

siderable friendship sprang up between Antiochus and Cicero⁷, which
was strengthened by the fact that many friends os the latter, such as
Piso⁸‚ Varro, Lucullus and Brutus, more or less adhered to the views
of Antiochus. Itis improbable that Cicero at this time became

acquainted with Aristus the brother os Antiochus, since in the Aca· ;

to Cicero in uc. 62. ,
