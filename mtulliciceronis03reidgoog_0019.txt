philosophy ; in Asia and at Rhodes he devoted himself principally to
rhetoric, under the guidance of the most noted Greek teachers, chief
of whom was his old friend Molo, the head of the Rhodian
school ¹. Cicero however formed while at Rhodes one friendship which
largely influenced his views of philosophy, that with Posidonius the
pupil of Panaetius, the most famous Stoic of the age. To him Cicero
makes reference in his works oftener than to any other instructor. He
speaks of him as the greatest of the Stoics'3 as a most notable philo
sopher, to visit whom Pompey, in the midst of his eastern campaigns,
put himself to much trouble⁸3 as a minute inquirer⁴. He is scarcely
ever mentioned without some expression of affection, and Cicero tells
us that he read his works more than those of any other Stoic author⁶.
Posidonius was at a later time resident at Rome ⁰, and stayed in Cicero’s
house. Hecato the Rhodian, another pupil of Panaetius, may have
been at Rhodes at this time. Mnesarchus and Dardanus, also hearers
of Panaetius, belonged to an earlier time, and although Cicero was
well acquainted with the works of the former, he does not seem to
have known either personally.

From the year 77 to the year 68 ac. when the series of letters
begins, Cicero was doubtless too busily engaged with legal and political
affairs to spend much time in systematic study. T hat his oratory owed
much to philosophy from the first he repeatedly insists 3 and we know
from his letters that it was his later practice to refresh his style b'y
much study of tbe Greek writers, and especially the philosophers.
During the period then, about which wehave little orno information‚
we may believe that he kept up his old knowledge by converse with
his many Roman friends who had a bent towards philosophy, as well
as with the Greeks who from timeto time came to Rome and fre-
quented the houses of the Optimates3 to this intercourse be added such
reading as his leisure would allow. The letters contained in the first
book of those addressed to Atticus, which range over the years 68-62
ae, afford many proofs of the abiding strength of his passion for
literary employment. In the earlier part of this time we find him ’
entreating Atticus to let him have a library which was then for sale3
expressing at the same time in the strongest language his loathing for
public affairs, and his love for books, to which he looks as the support
of his old age⁷. In the midst of bis busiest political occupations,
