when he was working his hardest sor the consulship, his heart was
given to the adomment os his Tusculan villa in a way suited to his
literary and philosophie testes· This may be taken as a specimen
of his spirit throughout his lise He was before all things a man oi
letters, compared with literature, pelides aud oratory held quite a
secundary place in his affections. Public business employed his in-
tellect, but never his heart

The year 62 released him from the consulship and enabled him
to indulge his literary tastes. To this year belong the publication os
his speeches, which were crowded, he says, with the maxims of philo
sopby¹ 3 the history os his consulship, in Latin and Greek, the Greek
version which he sent to Posidonius being modelled on Isocrates and

Aristotle3 and the poem on his consulship, of which some fragments¹

remain. A year or two later we find him reading with enthusiasm the
works os Dicaearchus, and keeping up his acquaintance with living
Greek philosophers'. His long lack oi leisure seerns to have caused
an almost unquenchable thirst for reading at this time. His friend
Paetus had inherited a valuable library, which he presented to Cicero.
, It was in Greece at the time, and Cicero thus writes to Atticus: ‘li
you love me and feel sure of my love ior you, use all the endeavours
oi your friends, clients, acquaintances, freedmen and even slaves to
prevent a single leaf from being lost...Every day 1 lind greater satis-
faction in study, so sar as my sorensic labours permit⁸.' At this period
of his lise Cicero spent much time in study at his estates near Tusculum,
Antium, Formiae, and elsewhere. I dwell with greater emphasis on
these facts, because oi the idea now spread abroad that Cicero was
amere dabbler in literature, and that his works were extempore para·

phrases os Greek books hals understood ln tuith, his appetite sor ¹

every kind of literature was insatiable, and his attainments in each
department considerable He was certainly the most learned Roman
of his age, with the single exception of Varro. One os his letters to
Atticus⁴ will give a sair picture oi his lise at this time. He especially
studied the political writings of the Greeks, such as Theophrastus and
Dicaearchus⁶. He also wrote historical memoirs aster the sashion os
Theopompus⁰.

The years from 59-57 ac. were years in which Cicero's private
cares ovcrwhelmed all thought of other occupatiori. Soou aster his
return from exile, in the year 56, he describes himself as ‘devouring
