literature’ with that marvellous man Dionysius¹, and laughingly
pronouncing that nothing is sweeter than universal knowledge He
spent great part of the year 55 at Cumae or Naples ‘feeding upon'
the library of Faustus Sulla, the son of the dictator¹. Literature formed
then, he tells us, his solace and support, and he would rather sit in
a garden seat which Atticus possessed, beneath a bust of Aristotle, than
in the ivory chair of office. Towards the end of the year he was
busily engaged on the De Oratore, a work which clearly proves his
continued familiarity with Greek philosophy⁸. In the following year (5'4)
he writes that politics must cease for him, and that he therefore returns
unreservedly to the life most in accordance with nature, that of the
, student⁴. During this year be was again for the most part resident at
those of his country villas where his best collections of books were.
At this time was written the Dc re publica, a work to which 1 may
appeal for evidence that his old philosophica] studies had by no means
been allowed to drop⁵. Aristotle is especially mentioned as one of
the authors read at this timei In the year 52 ac. came the De
tegritas, written amid distracting occupations; a work professedly
modelled on Plato and the older philosophers of the Socratic schools⁷.
In the year 51 Cicero, thenon his way to Cilicia, revisited Athens,
much to his own pleasure and that of the Atheniens He stayed in

the house of Aristus, the brother of Antiochus and teacher of Brutus. ,

His acquaintance with this philosopher was lasting, if we may judge
frorn the affectionate mention of him in the Brums⁸. Cicero also speaks
in kindly terms of Xeno, an Epicurean friend of Atticus, who was then
with Patro at Athens. It was at this time that Cicero interfered to
prevent Memmius, the patron of th‘e great Roman Epicurean Lucretius,
from destroying the house in which Epicurus had lived⁹. Cicero seems
to have been somewhat disappointed with the state of philosophy at
Athens, Aristus being the only ,man of merit then resident there¹⁰. On
the journey from Athens to his province, he made the acquaintance
of Cratippus, who afterwards taught at Athens as head of the Peripatetic
school¹¹. At this time Cratippus cante to visit Cicero at Mitylene, where
the orator seems to bave passed some time in his society¹’. He was by
