8 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

far the greatest, Cicero said, of all the Peripatetics he had himself
heard and indeed equal in merit to the most eminent of that school¹.

The care of that disordered province Cilicia was enough to employ ἵ

Cicero's thoughts till the end of 50. Yet he yearned for Athens and
philosophy. He wished to leave some memorial of himself at the
beautiful city, and anxiously asked Atticus whether it would look
foolish to build a πρόπυλον at the Academia, as Appius, his predecessor,
had done at Eleusis¹. It seems the Athenians of the time were in the
habit of adapting their ancient statues to suit the noble Romans of

the day, and of placing on them fulsome inscriptions. Of this practice κ

Cicero speaks with loathing. In one letter of this date he carefully
discusses the errors Atticus had pointed out in the books De re
publica⁸. His wishes with regard to Athens still kept their hold upon
his mind, audon his way home from Cilicia he spoke of conferring
on the city some signal favour‘. Cicero was anxious to show Rhodes,
with its school of eloquence, to the two boys Marcus and Quintus,
who accompanied him, and they probably touched there for a few

days⁵. From thence they went to Athens, where Cicero again stayed ’

with Aristus⁸, aud renewed his friendship with other philosophem‚
among them Xeno the friend of Atticus⁷.

On Cicero's return to Italy public affairs were ina very critical
condition, and left little room for thoughts about literature. The
letters which belong to this time are very pathetic. Cicero several
times coutrasts the statesmen of the time with the Scipio he had him-
self drawn in the De re publtia⁸3 when he thinks of Caesar, Plato’s
description of the tyrant is present to his mind⁹ 5 when he deliberates
about the course heis himself to take, he naturally recalls the example of
Socrates, who refused to leave Athens amid the misrule of the thirty
tyrants ¹⁰. It is curious to find Cicem, in the very midst of civil war,
· poring over the books of Demetrius the Magnesiau concerning concord ¹¹ 3
or employing his days iu arguing with himself a string of abstract
philosophical propositions about tyranny ¹². Nothing could more clearly
show that he was really a man of books; by nothing but accident
