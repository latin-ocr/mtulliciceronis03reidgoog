INTRODUCTION 9

a politician. In these evil days, however, no occupatiori was long to
his taste; books, letters, study, all in their turn became unpleasant ¹.

As soon as Cicero had become fully reconciled to Caesar in the
year 46 he returned with desperate energy to his old literary pursuits.
In a letter written to Varro in that year¹, he says, ‘I assure you Ι
had no sooner returned to Rorne than 1 renewed my intimacy with
my old friends, my books! These gave him real comfort, and his
studies seemed to bear richer fruit than in his days of prosperity'.
. The tenor of all his letters at this time is the same: see especially the
remaining letters to Varro and also to Sulpicius ⁴. The Partdioncs

oraarae, the Paradoxa, the Orator, and the Laudatrir Catonis, to
which Caesar replied by his A nticula, were all finished within the year.
Before the end of the year the Hortensius and the De I‘l'nibus had
probably both been planned and commenced. Early in the following
year the Academica, the history of which 1 shall trace elsewhere, was
vrrrtten.

l have now finished the first portion of my taslt5 l have shown
Cicero as the man of letters and the student of philosophy during that
portion of his life which preceded the writing of the Academica. Even
the evidence I have produced, which does not include such indirect
indications of philosophical study as might be obtained from the actual
philosophical works of Cicero, is sufficient to justify his boast that at no
time had he been divorced from philosophy ⁶. He was entitled to meet
the charge made by some people on the publication of his first book
of the later period—the Hortensius-that he was a mere tiro in phi-
losophy, by the assertion that on the contrary nothing had more oc·
cupied his thoughts throughout the whole of a wonderfully energetic
life⁶. His knowledge of philosophy must of course be estimated ulti·
mately by his extant works. These have been severely judged by some
leading scholars of recent timeS, but on wholly insufficient grounds.
The tide must one day turn, indeed is even now turning, and due grati·
tude will again be felt and expressed for the man who has preserved to
