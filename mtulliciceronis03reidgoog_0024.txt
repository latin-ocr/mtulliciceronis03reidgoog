is this. Cicero, the philosopher, is made to suffer for the short-
comings 01 Cicero the politician. Scholars who have learned to despise
his political weakness, vanity, and irresolution‚ make haste to depre-
ciate his achievements in philosophy, without troubling themselves to
inquire too closely into their intrinsic value. From political partisan·

In the time of Cicero students 01 philosophy nearly all belonged
to one of two opposing camps. The Stoic and the Epicurean systems
. each had alarge following. The Peripatetic sect numbered but a few ·
adherents¹. The New Academy had only at three periods in its history
attracted to it any large number 01 disciples, once when it was founded
by Arcesilas, again under the presidency 01 Carneades, and lastly
when Philo was at its head. Philo himself at the end 01 his life
ceased to preach the pure doctrine of Carneades, and when he died
the New Academy practically became extinct'. Meanwhile, Philo’s
pupil, Antiochus, had constructed a combination 01 Stoicism, Plato·
nism, and Peripateticism, which he dignified hythe name 01 the Old '
Academy, and lor which he secured some support. Of this system it
will be necessary to speak hereaster.

In attempting to deline Cicero's position with respect to the
various contemporary schools 01 thought, it will be best to follow the

division 01 philosophy (recognised by all the post-Aristotelian teachers),
into the three branches 01 Logic, Ethics‚ Physics'. For the moment

we may put aside the last-named branch. The only post-Aristotelian
school which possesseda system of physics in all respects peculiar to
itsell was the Epicurean⁴, and physical arguments were not prominent
in the controversies 01 the time. The two main tasks of the later
