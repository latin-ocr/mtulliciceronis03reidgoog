INTRODUCTIOM 1 1

Greek philosophy were, as Cicero often insists‚ one dialectical, the
establishment ol a criterion, such as would suffice to distinguish the
true from the false3 and one ethical, the determination os the summum
bonum, or moral standard¹. Itis convenient here to taire the dialec-

tical problem first (though in the eyes ol the ancients it was infinitely '

the less important os the two). All that was distinctive of the New
Academy was its dialectic¹. It proclaimed no peculias views either in
ethics or in physics. As the Sceptical school of Pyrrho was practically
in abeyance³, the New Academy had sor its own especial property the
doctrine that man is so constituted as to be incapable of reaching
absolute and certain truth ⁴. It was by virtue of accepting this tenet
that Cicero became and on all occasions declared himselfa sollower of
the New Academy.

It is easy to see what there was in this view to attract Cicero. His
mind was open and unprejudiced, receptive and impressible, to an ex-
traordinary degree, and utterly unfitted for a blind and deas defence os
any fixed dogma. His temperament also was gentle almost to sostness,
and he entirely lacked the robust confidence in seli which distinguishes
the dogmatis controversialist His experience as an orator also inclined
him towards the New Academy. He was accustomed to hear argu-¹
ments put iorward with equal persuasiveness on both sides os a case.
In other fields too it seemed to him arrogant to advance any proposi·
tion with a conviction of its absolute, indestructible and irrefragable
truth. One requisite oi a philosophy with him was that it should
avoid this arrogance⁵. Philosophers of the highest repute for ability
and sincerity had held the most opposite opinions on the same sub·
jects'. To withhold absolute assent from all doctrines, while giving
aqualified assent to those which seerned most probable, was the only
prudent course⁷. The diversities os view which the most famous intel-
lects exhibit, ought, said Cicero, to incline thinkers towards charity and
toleration, and to repel thern from the lury of dogmatism. Men ought to
teach and enlighten one another ina spirit of gentleness and moderatiori ⁸.
