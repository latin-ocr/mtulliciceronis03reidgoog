12 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

In positiveness of assertion there seemed to Cicero to be something
reckless and unseemly, and destructive of that dignity, balance, and
control which distinguish the Roman ideal of character¹. He fre
quently urges arguments also, which have had countless parallels in
“ modern times, to ¹show that the untrammelled conflict of opinion is
necessary to the progress of thought. To freedom of speculation
Greece owed the pre-eminence of her philosophers'. Wherever autho·
rity had loudly raised its voice, there philosophy had pined. Pytha-
goras is quoted⁸ as a warning example, and the baneful effects of
authority are often depicted⁴. The true philosophie spirit, Cicero said,
requires us not to maintain with obstinacy one view of a subiect, but to
study all views. It isa matter of duty to discuss all aspects of every
question, after the example of the Old Academy (ie. the immediate
successors of Plato and of Aristotle³). Those who demand strict dog-
matic formulas are mere busybodies⁶. The Academics glory in their
freedom ofjudgment. They are not compelled to defend an opinion
whether they will or no, merely because one· of their predecessors has
maintained it⁷. So far does Cicero carry this freedom, that in the fifth
book of the Tusculani Diipuiairbns he maintains a view entirely at
variance with the whole of the fourth book of the De Finibus, and
when the discrepancy is pointed out, refuses to be bound by his
former statements, on the plea that he is an Academia and a free
man⁸. ‘Modo hoc modo illud probabilius uidetur⁹.' The Academic
sips the best of every school ¹⁰. He roams in the wide field of philoso-
phy, while the Stoic dares not stira foot's breadth away from Chry-
sippus¹¹. The Academic is only anxious that people should combat his
opinions, for he makes it his aim, with Socrates, to free himself and
others from the mists of error¹². If he finds it easier to detect error
