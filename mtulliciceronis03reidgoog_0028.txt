14 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

an Eclectic¹. It may be questioned whether the title is suited to any

os the ancient writers on philosophy. At any rate the application of the
name to Cicero, without strict limitation and definition, may easily lead,
as it has led, to serious misconceptions regarding his position. Many οῖ’
the writers who dub Cicero ‘eclectic’ appear to think that they thereby
cast on him a grave reproach. The note or mark of eclecticism present
to the minds of these writers is want of originality. Now to charge
Cicero with wantos originality betrays a sailure to catch the spirit ol
the age in which he lived It was an age of exposition and com-
mentation, not an age of original thought, and this is just as une of the
Greek world at that period as of the Roman. No substantially novel
views os philosophy had been propounded since the time of Carneades ;
indeed we might say since the time os Arcesilas. 1t was tacitly assumed
on all hands that any one who pursued philosophy must needs attach
himself to one of the existing schools There was absolutely no
demand whatever sor views of truth which professed to be new¹.
Originality in a philosopher, far srom being looked upon as a merit,
would rather have been treated as a sin. Changes indeed, most pro·
found and momentous, were in progress. Old dogmas and formulas
were continually on the lips of the philosophers, and old controversial
battles were incessantly fought over again, yet the spirit of the com-
batants was vastly different from that of their intellectual forefathers.
The change however did not proceed from the speculations of any in-
dividuals, but was part os a general movement in culture and society.
Further, to speak of Cicero as an ‘eclectic’ is to lead unwary
readers to misapprehend, in particular, the standpoint of the New
Academy. The eclectic makes it his business to appropriate parts
of different systems, and weave them into a consistent whole. But
the New Academy was bound by the very condition os its existence to
refrain from inculcating any particular doctrines. Its one function was
to brcatbe into its disciples the spirit oi criticism‚ to drive out from
their minds that confident spirit of dogmatic assertion, which like some
wild and savage monster (so Cicero has 11³) dominated the adherents
of all the other philosophies. This task accomplished, the N ew Aca·
demy left its alumni absolutely free to accept any tenets whatever.
They were bound to consider all arguments which could be advanced
sor or against all doctrines, and then, striking a balance oi probabilities,
