INTRODUCTIOM 15

to adopt those views which appeared to have the advantage. But any

utterance of the New Academic was to be taken merely as expressing his
estimate os the probabilities at the moment. Il his estimate changed,

he not only might but must change his doctrine There was indeed
nothing in the principles of the New Academy to prevent one oi its
followers from accepting the Stoic scheme, or the Epicurean scheme
whole and entire, is he could conscientiously say that he had made
a thorough examination, and was merely giving expression to what he
supposed at the moment to be probably true. As a matter of fact,
tradition in a large measure intluenced the New Academic in the
acceptance and rejection of doctrines. But there was nothing that
could lairly be described as a New Academic system. For example,
the most intimate pupils os Carneades were unable to say what his real
opinion was concerning the question of questions sor all the thinlrers
atter Aristotle, the summurn bonum¹.

We must now turn to another point It has been supposed by
many scholars, on the strength of certain passages in the Academica
Postenora, that Cicero had sor a time abandoned the views he learned
t'rom Philo, and resumed thern just before the Academr'ca was written.
In § 13 Varro charges Cicero with deserting the Old Academy sor the
New, and Cicero seems to admit the charge. But one of the phrases
used by Varro (tractari autem nouam) points to a solution of the
difficulty. Varro evidently means that Cicero, having in earlier works
copied the roritings os ‘Old Academic' philosophers, is about to draw
on the literary stores of the New Academy. In composing the Rc-
paolo, Do Lego‘bus, Consolatio, Heremias and other works, he had
used writings which were in the phraseology of the day all classed
as ‘Old Academic,’ a term under which the earlier Peripatetic and
Academic literature was ranked, along with the soi-disant ‘Old Aca·
demic' treatises of Antiochus. As the works just mentioned were
entirely ethical or political in their bearing, the use of them involved no
abandonment of the one thing needful for the follower os the New
Academy, the Cameadean dialectic. Thatamodifiedacquiescenceinthe
ethical opinions os Antiochus was, in Cicero’s view, quite compatible with
the spirit of critical inquiry which he had learned from Philo, is shown

by another passage in the Academica Posteriora (ξ 7), which has caused
much unnecessary trouble to the commentators. Cicero there states
that he, in common with Varro, regards with favour (probamur) the
‘uetus Academia,’ which the context shows to be the ‘uetus Academia’
