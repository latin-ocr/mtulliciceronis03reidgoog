16 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

as expounded by Antiochus ¹. As Cicero is on ’the very point of
attacking the Antiochean dialectic, his approval can only be intended
to refer to the ethical and physical sides os Antiochus’ system As the
duty of doubt and the theory oi probability had not been set forth
in any work, either Greek or Roman, for thirty or forty years,
Cicero's advocacy os the Philonian dialectic might well appear to

Varro as an act os desertion’. It must also be remembered‚ whenever ἲ
Cicero speaks os the ‘uetus Academia,' that he dissented entirely from ’
that estimate of Plato's early successors, for which Antiochus contended, 5

and maintained that from Socrates to Philo no Academic teacher had
been a dogmatist, so that to speak of an Old anda New Academy was
amistake⁸.

We can now pass to Cicero’s view of the ethical problem. The
determination of an ethical standard was in the eyes of the post-Aristo-
telian philosophers the grand purpose, end and aim of philosophy,
which was emphatically defined as ‘the artos conduct’ or ‘the art
os living’ (ars utitendt'⁴). All speculative and nonethical doctrines
were merely estimable as supplying a basis on which this practica} art
could be reared This is equally true of Pyrrho’s scepticism and of

the dogmatism of Zeno and Epicurus. If the dogmatists objected to '

the dialectic ol the New Academy, it was only because in their opinion
it logically led to the subversion ol morality⁸. Cicero is therefore
greatly concerned in the Lumllus to prove that probability issul-
ficient to afford that stable basis for moral practice which he felt to be
necessary. The New Academics generally toolr firmer ground in ethica]
matters than the Sceptics⁰, and Cicero often went beyond his own friends
in this respect Thus in the De Lega'bro, when the conversation
tums on a question in morals, he begs the New Academy, which has
introduced confusion into these subjects, to¹ be silent⁷. There can be
”· no doubt that Cicero was deeply influenced throughout his life by
the scheme os ethics which he had learned from Antiochus In all
Cicero’s works which touch on moral or politica] questions that philo-
sopher is mentioned with great respect⁸. But all systems which seemed
