to assure to moral principles a sound basis had sor Cicero a great at·
traction. He was, in his later days, fascinated by the Stoics almost
beyond the power ot resistance. In respect of their ethical and religi-
ous ideas he calls them ‘great and famous philosophers¹,' and he fre·
quently speaks with something like shame of the treatment they had
received at the hands of Arcesilas arrd Carneades. Once he expresses a
sear lest they should be the only true philosophers aster all¹. There was
a magnificence about the Stoic utterances on morality, more suited to a ο
superhuman than a human world, which allured Cicero more than the
barrermess os the Stoic dialectic repelled him³. In a remarkable pas·
sage⁴, he assents to the distinctively Stoic doctrine that virtueis incapable
of degree, and expressly rejects the position os Antiochus that a life
enriched by virtue but unattended by other advantages might be happy,
but could not bc the happiest possible. He begs the Academic and ’
Peripatetic Schools to cease from giving an uncertain sound³, and to
allow that the happiness of the wisc man would remain unimpaired
even if be were thrust into the bull of Phalaris. In another place he
admits tbe purely Stoic doctrine that virtue is one and indivisible⁰.
Tbese opinions, however, he will not allow to bc distinctively Stoic, but
appeals to Socrates as his authority for them⁷. Zen0, who is merely an
ignoble crastsman oi words, stole them from the older philosophers ol
the Academy. This is Cicero’s general feeling with regard to Zeno,
and there can be no doubt that he caught it from Antiochus who, in
sterling the doctrines of Zeno, ever stoutly maintained that Zeno had
stolen them before. Cicer0, however, regarded chiefly the ethics of
Zeno with this feeling, while Antiochus so regarded chiefly the dialectic.
It is just in this that the main difference between Antiochus and Cicero
lies. To the former Zeno's dialectic was true and Socratic, while the
latter treated it as unSocratic, looking upon Socrates as the apostle ol·
doubt⁸. On the whole Cicero went beyond Antiochus in his sympathy
with the Stoic ethics. Not at every point, however, for while Antio
chus accepted without reserve the Stoic paradoxes, Cicero hesitatingly
allowed them, though he admitted that they vvere Socratic⁹. Again,
Antiochus subscribed to the Stoic theory that all emotion wassinsu13
