Cicero’s temperament led him to refuse it with horror¹. On some
questions, as we have already seen, Cicero wavered. In the De
Finibus he argued that the difference between the Stoic and Peri·
patetic ethics was merely one of terms3 in the Tusculun Disputa-
tions he held it to be real. The most Stoic in tone of all his worlrs
are the Τ asculan Disputations and the De Offia'is'.

The third branch of philosophy, that concemed with natural pheno
mena, was in Cicero’s 'age accounted of small importance compared
with ethics. Physical investigations were only ‘valued for the effect they
might have on ethical speculatiou or practice. Cicero esteemed physical
science mainly as a form of culture⁸. The atomism of the Epicureans
and the pantheistic materialism of the Stoics were alilre directed to secur-
ing for the wisc man the perfect repose of mind which was necessary for
the full realisation of his ethical ideal. In all ancient systems, theology
was recogniscd as a division of natural science. The religious clement
in Cicero's nature inclined him very strongly to sympathise with the
Stoic views of the grand universal operation of divine power. Piety‚
purity, and moral good were impossible in any form, he thought, if
the divine govemment of the universe were denied⁴. He was grieved

that Carneades should have found it necessary to oppose the beautiful ’

Stoic theology, and he defends the great sceptic by the plea that his
one aim was to rouse men to the investigation of the truth⁵. The
fatalistic and pantheistic aspect of the Stoic physics, which was ac·
cepted by Antiochus⁶, Cicero reiected, as became a follower of Car·
neades, who had spent much of his life in ridiculing the Stoic εἱμαρμένη.
In the general outlines of physica, Cicero chiefly followed Antiochus,
whose scheme is propounded in the Academica Postcrzirra. That
philosopher, while owingmuch to the Stoics, drew largely upon the
Trinaeus of Plato, a work which Cicero knew and translated, though
like all other readers os the dialogue he found it hard to understand.
Many of the Stoic notions which entered into the Antiocheam physics

were ultimately derived from Aristotle, but the physical treatises ol κ

that philosopher were in Cicero's time idaccessible, or at all events
