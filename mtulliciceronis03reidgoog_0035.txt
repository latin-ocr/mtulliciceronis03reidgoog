INTRODUCTION 21

Such philosophica] literature as existed in Latin when Cicero began
to write was almost entirely Epicurean, and that too (putting Lucretius
aside) of a very miserable character. C. Amafinius, mentioned in the
Academiam, was the first to write, and his books seem to have had
an enonnous citculation'. He found a host of imitators, who obtained
suc'h a favourable reception that, in Cicero's strong language, they took
possession of the whole of Italy⁸. A certain Rabirius and one Catius
an Insubrian‚ ,of whom scarcely anything is known but their names,
were two of the most noted of these writers⁴. Cicero assigns various
reasons for their extreme popularity: the easy nature of the Epicurean
physics, the fact that there was no other philosophy for Latin readers,
and the voluptuous blandishments of pleasure when proposed as an
ethical end. This last cause, as in one passage he seems to allow,
must have been of small importance. Itis not a little remarkable that
the whole of the Roman Epicurean literature was almost exclusively
devoted to the physical side of the system⁸. The Romans had as yet
a strong practical basis for morality in the legal and social constitution
of the family, and in their political life, and did not feel the need
of theoretical systema, though the extinction of liberty was soon to
produce the same effect it had occasioned in Greece. On the other hand
the general decay among the educated classes of a belief in the super-
natural, accompanied as ‘it was by an increase of superstition among
the masses, caused many readers to turn with avidity to aphilosophy
which offered a purely mechanical explanation of the universe.

These Roman Epicureans are continually reproached by Cicero
with their uncouth style of writingt They are bad translators of bad
originals⁷. He indeed confesses he had not read them⁸, but we may
well believe that the reports he followed were true. A curious question ⁵
here arises, how it was that Cicero, in speaking of the Roman Epicurean
literature, never mentioned Lucretius. Probably at this time the poems
of Lucretius had not yet made their way, and Cicero, unable to include
the great poet in his sweeping condemnation, and unwilling to allow
that anything good could come from the school of Epicurus, preferred
