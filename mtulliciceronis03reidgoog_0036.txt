22 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

to keep silence conceming a little-known writer, about whom his
readers would not expect him to express an opinion ¹.

Cicero hated and despised Epicureanism most sincerely‚ and one
of his chief aims in undertaking his philosophical works was to stem
the tide of its popularity in Italy. At the same time, as a patriot,
he felt shame that the literature of his country should be destitute
just where Greek was richest He often tn'es by the most far-fetched
arguments to shew that philosophy had lest its mark on the Italian
peoples in early times'. We have seen that there were many men of
culture who did not object to philosophy so long as it was taught and read
in Greek. To these he replies with indignation, accusing them of being
untrue to their country⁸. It would bea glorious thing, he thinks, if
Romans were no longer absolutely compelled to resort to the Greeks‘.

He will not even concede that Greek is a richer tongue than Latini
As for the alleged incapacity of the Roman intellect to deal with
philosophical inquiries, he will not hear of it Itis only, he says,
because the energy of the nation has been diverted into other chanuels
that so little progress has been made in this direction. The history of
Roman oratory is referred to in support of this opinion⁶. If only an im-
pulse were given at Rome to the pursuit of philosophy, already on the

wane in Greece, Cicero thought that it would llourish and take the
place of oratory, which he believed to be expiring amid the din of civil
war⁷. He moreover clearly foresaw that the abolition of the old consti-
tution of the state would drive many Romans in future to seek con-
solation in abstract studies⁸.

There can be no doubt that Cicero was penetrated by the belief
that if he wrote on philosophy he would do his country a real service⁰.
