In his enforced politieal inaction and amid the disorganisation of the
law courts, it was only by such work that he could render any service
at all¹. He is within his right when he claims praise for not abandoning
himself to idleness or worse, as did so many oi the most prominent “
men of his time¹. For Cicero, idleness was at all times misery, aud

in those evil days he was spurred on to exertion by the deepest sorrow⁸.
Philosophy took for him the place of forensic oratory, public harangues
and politics⁴. Itis strange to find Cicero making such elaborate
apologies for devoting himself to the study of philosophy, and a careless
reader might set them down to egotism. But it must never be forgotten
that at Rome all literary and artistic pursnits were merely the amusement
of the wealthy 3 the total devotion of alife to them seemed well enough
for Greeks, but for Romans unmanly and unpractical³. Politics, oratory
and war were the only worthy lifelong occupations for the Romans
of wealth and ability. There were plenty of Romane, even in Cicero’s ,
time, ready to condemn literature and art altogether, as effeminate
inventions of the Greeks. Some, while not objecting to other forms
of literature, despised philosophy, and thought any Roman statesman
degraded who meddled with it⁶. Others, like the Neoptolemus of
Ennius, thought a little learning in philosophy was good, but that a
great deal of it was a dangerous thing⁷. Some few preferred that
Cicero should write on other subjects⁸. 'l'o these he replies by urging
the pressing necessity there was for works in Latin on philosophy.

Still, amid much depreciation, sufficient interest and sympathy
were roused by his first philosophical works to encourage Cicero to
proceed. 'l'he elder generation, for whose approbation he most cared,

praised the books and many were induced both to read and to write .

works on philosophy⁹. Cicero now extended his plan, which was at first
only tentative, so as to bring within its scope every topic which Greek
philosophers were accustomed to treat ¹⁰. Separate topics in philosophy
