additions as he made to the originalswere prescribed by two require-

the dialogue—secondly, the interests of Roman readers, for whom
episodes and illustrations from the history and literature of their own ”
country were introduced. 'l'o speak of the latter class of additions first,

it must be remembered that, in the eyes of the average Roman, philo·
sophy in itself lacked dignity¹, and could only be attractiva when set in

a Roman frame.

All Cicero’s philosophica] works are written in the form of dia-
logum, but the dialogue was of the later Greek type, and not of the
kind with which we are so familiar from the works of Plato. 'ihis form
seems to have died with Plato. The later form was much less dra·
matic, contained much less of question and answer and of repartee, and
much more of continuous exposition. The conversation between the
characters was confined to asew episodes, and the various conflicting
views of the subject discussed were delivered in uninterrupted‚ or
scarcely intermpted speeches oi considerable length⁸.

Cicero himself mentions two styles of dialogue which he followed,
that of Heraclides, who introduced as dramatis personae famous men
of a bygone time, and that of Aristotle, who always appeared himself
as an interlocutor in his dialogueS, and played the leading parti He
mentions the De re publica as Heraclidean, and to the same class
belong the Laelius and the Cato Maior. As Aristotelian he mentions

though to the same category belong all Cicero’s dialogum, with the
exception of the three mentioned above, and perhaps the Da Oratore.
About this work Cicero's language is inconsistent. In one passage
(Art. x111. 19, 4) he implies that he regards it as written after the
fashion of Heraclides. In another (Fam. 1. 9, 23) he says it is written
