26 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

former passage os the ‘mos Aristotelius' [⁴in quo sermo ita induci-

tur ceterorum ut penes ipsum sit' principatus'] this judgment is not
strictly correct.

It has been explained that Cicero's philosophical works are in sub-
stance translations, though free translations, from Greek originals. The
Greek works on which they are founded have, with the exception of
a few passages, for the most part unimportant, been lost. In fact these
works of Cicero are, for most of the subjects with which they deal, the
oldest authorities we now possess, and in many portions they are the
only authorities. It is therefore of importance to determine how far
they can be trusted as representing the sources from which they were
drawn. This question ean only be decided by laborious investiga·
tion into the whole of the existing ancient testimony to the doctrines
of the post-Aristotelian schools In spite of all that has been done in
recent times, the taslr is one which still in substance remains for
scholars to accomplish. There can be no doubt at the present moment
that ,a low estimate prevails of Cicero's accuracy and of the value of
his writings¹. Long observation and inquiry has, however, convinced
me that this estimate rests almost entirely on misconception or preju-
dice. It is impossible for me here to treat of the matter to any extent
in detail 3 I can only indicate in a general way what appear to be
some of the chief sources of prevalent errors conceming the 'worth
of Cicero's philosophical works. Personal prejudice against the man,
derived from a consideration of his political career, has produced much
effect ¹. But with this matter I cannot here deal

The most careless readers cannot fail to find in the philosophical
writings of Cicero many superficial contradictions and inconsistencies,
much inconstancy in the use os terms‚ no little inconsequence in
argument, and considerable want of lucidity in the arrangement of
subject-matter. When these faults are observed it is the practice of
some scholars to lay the guilt at Cicero's door, and to let the Greeks
go free from blame. Now I do not hesitate to assert that the further
inquiry is pushed into the sources of the post-Aristotelian philosophy,
the more plainly will the fact come to light that the defects complained
of existed already in the Greek authors whom Cicero copied. In the
whole of the Greek philosophy the feeling for consistency is found
