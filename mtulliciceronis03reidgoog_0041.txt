INTRODUCTION. 27

in a very imperfectly developed state. Contradictions which appear
to a modern reader superficial and glaring are passed over without
misgiving by even a Plato or an Aristotle. In the sense sor orderly
arrangement and regular development of arguments, and in stringency
in the use ol technical terms, the whole of the ancient philosophy is
very deficient whenjudged by a modern standard¹. Now ol all the
Greek systems the worst in these respects was that with which Cicero
had most to deal, the Stoic. Itis not too much to say that it was, in
its details, a tangled web of inconsistencies, even as expounded by its
highest authorities¹.

It is very seldom that we can bring a passage of Cicero lace to
face with the Greek passage from which it was translated. Diogenes
Laertius, Stobaeus, and other writers os their class give us as a rule only
their general impressions os the different philosophies‚ without naming
the portions os the ancient writings from which they drew the im-
pressions. Opinions are vaguely put down to ‘Chrysippus’ or ‘the
Stoics‚’ and so on. When assertions of this kind conflict with asser·
tions ascribed to the same persons by Cicero, scholars have been too
ready to jump to the conclusion that Cicero has blundered. They
have forgotten that what Chrysippus maintained in one work he denied

in another, and that the Stoic system took very different forms in the
mouths of its different exponents. Confirmations ol Cicero's accuracy

ot'ten come to light in the most unexpected quartem, and unless a
scholar can conscientiously say that he has examined every ancient
passage which bears upon any point in question, he will be very rash
in pronouncing dogmatically that Cicero is in error⁸. Evenwhere
no confirmation exists elsewhere, it is always possible and generally
probable that we have some isolated utterance which Cicero alone
has preserved.
