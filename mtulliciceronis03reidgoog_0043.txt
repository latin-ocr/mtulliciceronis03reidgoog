INTRODUCTIOM 29

found the mechanic exercise of composition the best solace for his pain,
and wrote for whole days together¹. At other times he would plunge at
early morning into the dense woods near his villa, and remain there
absorbed in study till nightfall'. Often exertion failed to bring relief ⁸ ;

yet he repelled the entreaties of Atticus that he would return to the
forum and the senate. A grief which books and solitude could scarcely
enable him to endure, would crush him, he felt, in the busy city⁴.

It was amid such surroundings that the Academica was written.
During the first part of his stay at Astura, Cicero was busy with his Con- ²
solaow, and possibly his Isiortenn'uff. The first trace of any intention to
write the Academico is found in a letter to Atticus, probably written in
the earlier days of his stay at Astura⁷. Atticus had awery wide know·
ledge of history and biography⁸, and Cicero often applied to him for
’ minute information about the characters or events mentioned in his dia-
logues. In the letter in question he asks for just the kind of information
which would be needed in writing the Academico. The words with
which he introduces his request imply that he had determined to under·
take some new work to which our Acaeloor'co would correspond⁰. He
asks what reason the embassy of which Carneades formed part had for
coming to Rome ; who was at that time the leader of the Epicurean
