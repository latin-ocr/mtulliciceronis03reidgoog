Another view of the συντάγματα is that they represent the Academica
which was at first divided into two books. Against this Madvig urgeda
singularly unfortunate objection. He held that the word σύνταγμα

could not be applied to aporrrbn of a work. This judgment is very
nearly the reverse of the truth ; tlie fact being that the word nearly
always is so applied wherever it occurs¹. Its use is indeed a very
strong argument against the opinion of Madvig, and tells equally against
the contentiori of Krische that the books in question were the Hortanius
and the Academica. The Hortensius is never mentioned in Cicero's
letters, and it may possibly have been finished before he went to Astura¹.
There is therefore strong ground for supposing that by the ισνντσὶγμιιτνι’
Cicero meant the Academica as he first wrote it

Whatever be the truth on this point it cannot be disputed that the
Hortensius and the Academica must have been more closely connected,
in style and tone, than any other tvo works of Cicero. The interlocu-
tors in the two dialogues were exactly the same, for the introduction of
the name of Balbus into some fragments of the Herennius is an error ⁸.
