The discussion in the Academica Priora is carried on at the villa of
Hortensius near Bauli 5 in the Hortensiae at the villa of Lucullus near
Cumae Itis rather surprising that under these circumstances there
should be only one direct reference to the Hortmstics in the Lucullus.
’ The Academica in its original form was no doubt sent' to Atticus
· very soon after Cicero reached Tusculum ¹. Probably Atticus, who
visited Cicero at Tusculum, made some objections to the way in which
Cicero had put learned arguments into the mouths of unleamed men¹;
so Cicero took the book back and added to each division of it a new
introduction, returning the book for Atticus’ approval⁸. In all proba-
bility the extant prooemium of the Lumllus is the one which Cicero
then affixed. These prooemia constituted a deliberate attempt on the
part of Cicero to impose upon his readers a set of statements concern-
ing the intellectual ability and culture of Catulus and Lucullus which he
knew and in his own letters to Atticus admitted to be false⁴. I may
note, as of sorne interest in connexion with the Academica, that among
the uupleasant visits received by Cicero at Tusculum was one from
Varro⁵. .
On the 21st June, Cicero left Tusculum for Arpinum, in order,
he says, to arrange some business connected with property there, and
also to relieve Brutus from the burden which his assiduous attentions
imposed on him⁶. Cicero seems to have been still unsatislied with his
choice of interlocutors for the Acadmico, and the first thing he did on
his arrival was to transfer the parts of Lucullus and Hortensius to Cato
and Brutus, the part of Catulus he probably added to his own'. This
plan was speedily cast aside on the arrival of a letter from Atticus,
strongly urging that the whole work should be dedicated to Varro, or if
