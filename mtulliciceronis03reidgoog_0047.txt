not the Academica then the De Ft'nimsl Cicero had never been very
intimate with Varro 5 their acquaintance seems to have been maintained
through Atticus, who was at all times anxious to draw them more
closely together. Nine years earlier he had pressed Cicero to find
room in his works sor some honourable employment os Varro's name².
The nature of the works on which Cicero was then engaged rendered it
difficult sor him to comply with the request³. Varro had promised on
his side to dedicate to Cicero an important worlc In answer to the
later entreaty of Atticus, Cicero declared himself very much dissatisfied
with Varro's failure to fulfil his promise From this it is evident that
Cicero knew nothing of the scope or magnitude os the De lingua
Latera, a portion of which Varro afterwards dedicated to him. His ·
complaint that Varro had been writing for two years without making
any progress‚ shows how little familiarity there can have been between
the two⁴. Cicero was minded to walt for Varro’s promised gist and then
to repay it by a richer present ⁶. But, apart from these causes for
grumbling, Cicero thought the new suggestion ol Atticus a ‘ godsend ’ ⁸.
Since the De linibus was already ‘betrothed’ to Brutus ⁷, he promised
to transfer to Varro the Academica, allowing that Catulus and Lucullus,
though ef noble birth, had no claim to be considered learned ⁸. So little

' ⁵ learning did they possess that they could not even have dreamed os the

doctrines they had been made in the first edition of the Academica to
maintain⁹. For them another place was to be found, and the remark
