ness¹. Again and again Cicero professed to doubt whether Varro really
desired to receive the dedication ; again and again Atticus assured him
that on that score there was nothing to fear. Still Cicero was not satisfied,
and wished Atticus to state exactly the grounds he had for this confi-
dence⁹. Atticus seems to have thought that Cicero’s hesitation was
caused by the possibility that people might accuse him of hunting after
notoriety if he dedicated anything to Varro without being first chal· ’
lenged by a similar dedication from Varro. This idea Cicero denies³.

In order to stimulate his friend, Atticus affirmed that Varro was jealous

of some to whom Cicero had shown more favour. We find Cicero
eagerly asking for more information on this point: was it Brutus of
whom Varro was jealous⁴i It seems strange that Cicero should not
have entered into correspondence with Varro himself. But the lite· ,
rary etiquette of the day seems to have required that the recipient
0f a dedication should be assumed to be ignorant of the donor's inl
tentions till they were on the very point of being carried out. Thus
although Cicero saw Brutus frequently while at Tusculum, he apparently
did not speak to him about the De linibus, but employed Atticus to
ascertain his feeling about the dedication⁶.

Cicero’s own judgment conceming the completed second edition of
the Academica is several times given in the letters. He tells us that it * ’
extended on the whole to greater length than the first edition, though
much had been omitted, and adds ‘unless human sels-love deceives me,
the books have been so finished that the Greeks themselves have no
thing in the same department of literature to approach them... This
edition will be more brilliant, more terse, and altogether better than the
last⁸.’ Again: ‘the Antiochean portion has all the keenness of Antio· ·
chus combined with any polish my style may possess⁷.' Als0: ‘I have
finished the work with Ι know not what success, hut with a care which
nothing could surpass⁸.’ In another passage he calls them ‘sane argu-
