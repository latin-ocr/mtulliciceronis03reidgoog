tulos libros ¹.’ The binding and adornment of the presentation copy for
Varro received great attention, and the letter accompanying it was
highly elaborated'. Yet after everything had been done and the book
had been sent to Atticus at Rome, Cicero was still uneasy about the
reception it would meet with from Varro. He wrote thus to Atticus:
‘I tell you again and again that the presentation will be at your own
risk. So if you begin to hesitate, let us desert to Bmtus, who also is a
follower of Antiochus. OAcademy on the wing, as ever, tlitting now
hither, now thither⁸l' Atticus on his part ‘shuddered' at the idea of
taking the responsibility⁴. After the work had passed into his hands
Cicero begged him to take all precautions to prevent it from getting into-
circulation until the two could meet, and decide its fate. Τὴε warning
was necessary, because two persons, Balbus and Caerellia, had just

„ managed to copy Cicero’s ns of the DeFint'bus‘. In a letter, written

apparently a day or two later, Cicero again declared his intention. of
meeting Atticus at Rome, and of then sending the work to Varro if it
’ should be deemed advisable to do so‘. The meeting ultimately did not
take place, and Cicero left the four books in Atticus' power, promising
to approve any course that might be taken ⁷. Atticus wrote to say that
³ assoon as Varro came to Rome the books should be sent to him. ‘By'
this time then,' says Cicero when he gets the letter, ‘you have taken the ,
fatal step 5 ahl if you only knew at what peril to yourselfl Perhaps my
letter stopped you, though you had not read it when you wrote. I long
to hear how the matter stands³.' Again‚ a little later: ‘Yon have been
bold enough, then, to give Varro the books? Iawait his judgment
upon thern, but when will he read them⁹?’ Varro probably received
the gift in the first fortnight of August, 45 uc, when Cicero was already
