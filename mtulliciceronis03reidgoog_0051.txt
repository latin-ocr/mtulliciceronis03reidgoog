‚ had already got into Varro’s hands, as we leam 110111 a letter in which
J Cicero begs Atticus to ask Varro to make some alterations in his copy
01 the Academica, at a time when the sate 01 the second edition was still

undecided¹. From this fact we may conclude that Cicero had given up Ι

’ all hope 01 suppressing the first edition. Indeed he never betrays in
his letters to Atticus any anxiety that it should be suppressed He
does, it is true, console Atticus 101 the labour lost iu copying the first

edition', but he assumes that Atticus will prefer to bave the ‘splendidiora . ι

, breuiora, meliora⁸.' Still, on every occasion which offered, the author .
sought to point out as his authorised edition the one in four books. ,
He did so in a passage written immediately aster the Academica Poste· '
rcora was completed⁴3 and osten subsequently, when he most markedly ,
mentioned the number 01 the books as four⁸. That he wished the work

. to bear the title Academica is clear⁰. The expressions Ἀκαδημικῆ

<tuleratis⁷ and Acadcmca⁰ are merely descriptive, so also is the
frequent appellation Academici latret The title Academicae Quaes-
tiones found in many editions is a misnomer. It is an imitation 01 the
title Tusculanae Quaestione, and was supported by the false notion,
current as early as the time 01 the elder Pliny, that Cicero had a villa
near Puteoli called ‘Academia' at which the book was written and from
which 11 took its name, just as the later book took its name from
the villa at Tusculum¹⁰. The Academica was, however, as we have
