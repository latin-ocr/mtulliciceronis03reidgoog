-38 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

seen, entirely written at Astura and Arpinum. But even bad it been
otherwise the title Academicac Quaesticnes could only mean ‘particular
problerrs discussed in the Academia,' a title entirely unsuited to a work
which gives a complete exposition of the principles of a whole school
The title is equally unsuitable if, with some editors (Ernesti and others),
we take it to mean ‘problems connected with the Academic school¹.’
But it is more than doubtful whether Cicero could ever have called his
villa at Puteoli by the name ‘Academia' Pliny seems to have founded
his statement on an epigram conceming the villa which he quotes, and
which speaks of ‘Academiae celebratam nomine villam! Now it was
the custom for the wealthy Romans of Cicero’s day to give to certain
shaded walks around their country houses the title Academia or Lydum.
Cicero had both a Lycaon, and an Acadcmc‘a at Tusculum'. He may
also have had an Academia in his grounds at Puteoli, though we have
no evidence of the fact, or his successor in the villa (which no doubt
soonbecame a show place for toun'sts) may have given the name to one
of the walks or tenaces.

As to the subsequent late of the two editions, we oen only gather
scanty information from quotations. The second edition was far oftener
referred to than the first. No fragments have been preserved which
can with probability be referred to the lost portion of the earlier edition
lactantius, Augustine‚ Nonius and Diomedes quote always the Aca-
demica Pastcm'cra. The work is usually quoted under the title Academica,
though Lactantius sometimes, and Augustine always used the name libri
= Academici. Quintilian knew both recensions⁸, Plutarch only the earlier⁴.
T he quotations of Ammianus Marcellinus seem to be from the Aca-
demica Priora ⁵.

Ι have thought it advisable to set forth in plain terms the history of
the genesis of the book, as gathered from Cicero’s letters to Atticus
Τ hat it was not unnecessary to do so may be seen frorn the astounding
theories which old scholars of great repute put forward conceming the
two recensions⁶, and from the blunders which are still occasionally made
by unwary editors of Cicero’s philosophical works⁷.
