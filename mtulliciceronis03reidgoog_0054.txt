. 40 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

one voice ‘On you¹.’ He alone was bold enough to rebuke the follies,
on the one hand, of the ¹mob, on the other, of the senate¹. No storm
of danger, no favouring breeze' of fortune, could ever inspire in him either

sear or hope, or cause him to swerve from his own course⁸. His influence, ἵ

though he be dead, will ever live among his countrymen⁴. He was not
only glori0us in his life, but fortunate in his death¹.

Apart from Cicero's general agreement with Catulus in politics, there
were special causes for his enthusiasm. Catulus was one of the m'ri con-

sulares who had given their unreserved approval to the measures taken .

for the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was the first to
confer on Cicero the greatest glory of his life, the title ‘father of his
country⁸.' So closely did Cicero suppose himself to be allied to Catulus,
that a friend tried to console him for the death of Tullia, by bidding him
remember ‘Catulus and the olden times⁷.' The statement of Catulus,
often referred to by Cicero, that Rome had never been so unfortunate
as to have two bad consuls in the same year, except when Cinna held
the office, was intended to point a contrast between the real of Cicero

and the lukewarmness of his colleague Antonius⁸. Archias, who ,

engaged to write a poem in honour of Cicero's consulship, lived in the
house of the two Catuli⁹.

We have seen that when Cicero found it too late to withdraw the
first edition of the Academica from circulation, hc affixed a prooemium to

each book, Catulus being lauded in the first, Lucullus in the second. ἵ
, From the passages above quoted, and from our knowledge of Cicero’s

habit in such matters, we can have no difficulty in conjecturing at least a
portion of, the contenta of the lost prooemium to the Catulus. The
achievements of the elder Catulus were probably extolled, as well as
those of his son. The philosophical knowledge of the elder man was
made to cast its lustre on the younger. Cicero’s glori0us consulship
was once more lauded, and great stress was laid upon the patronage it
received from so famous a man as the younger Catulus, whose praises
were sung in the fervid language which Cicero lavishes on the same
theme elsewhere Some allusion most likely was made to the con-
nexion of Archias with the Catuli, and to the poem he had promised to
write in Cicero’s honour. Then the occasion of the dialogue, its sup
