posed date, and the place where it was held, were indicated. The place
was the Cumaeam villa of Catulus ¹. The leigned date must fall between
the year 60 rac. in which Catulus died, and 63, the year os Cicero’s con-
sulship, which is alluded to in the Lucullus'. It is well known that in
the arrangement os his dialogues Cicero took every precaution against
anachronisms⁸.

The prooemium ended, the dialogue commenced. Allusion was
undoubtedly made to the Hortensius, in which the same speakers had
been engaged} and aster more compliments had been bandied about,
most of which would sall to Cicero’s share, a proposal was made to dis-
cuss the great disserence between the dogmatic and the sceptic schools
Catulus offered to give his father’s views, at the same time commending
his fathers s knowledge ol philosophy. Before we proceed to construet
in outline the speech os Catulus from indications offered by the Lucullus,
it is necessary to say something os the character and philosophical
opinions os Catulus the elder.

lu the many passages where Cicero speaks of him, he seldom omits
to mention his sapr'entr'a, which implies a certain knowledge of philoso-
phy. He was, says Cicero, the kindest, the most upright‚ the wisest,
the purest of men⁴. He was a manos universal merit, os surpassing

worth, a second Laeliusl. Itis easy to gather from the De Oratore, in ¹

which he appears as an interlocutor, a more detailed view of his accom-

plishmehts. Throughout the second and third books he is treated as ’ “

the lettered man, par excellence, oi the company⁸. Appeal is made to
him when any question is started which touches on Greek literature and
philosophy. We are especially told that even with Greeks his acquaint-
ance with Greek, and his style os speaking it, won admiration⁷. He

defends the Greeks from the attacks of Crassus³. He contemptuously .

contrasts the Latin historiens with the Greek⁹. He depreciates the
later Greek rhetorical teaching, while he bestows high commendation on
the early sophists ¹⁰. The systematic rhetoric of Aristotle and Theophras
tus is most to his mind¹¹. An account is given by him os the history os
Greek speculation in Italy¹¹. The undefiled purity of his Latin style
made him seem to many the only true speaker os the language¹⁸. He
