42 ’ THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

had written a history of his own deeds, iu the style of Xenophon, which

Cicero had imitated ¹, and was well known as a wit and writer of

epigrams'.

. Although so much is said of his general culture, it is only from the
Academica that we learn definitely his philosophical opinions. In the

De Oratore, when he speaks of the visit of Carneades to Rome⁸‚ he does

not declare himself a follower of that philosopher, nor does Crassus, in

Ι his long speech about Greek philosophy, connect Catulus with any

· particular teachers The only Greek especially mentioned as a friend of
his, is the poet Antipater of Sidon⁴. Still it might have been concluded‚
even from the De Oratore, that he was an adherent either of the Academic
or of the Peripatetic school. Cicero repeatedly asserts that from no
other schools can an orator spring, and the whole tone of the De Oratore
shows that Catulus could have had no leaning towards the Stoics or
Epicureans⁵. The probability is that he had never placed himself under
the instruction of Greek teachers for any length of time, but had rather
gained his information from books and especially from the waitings of
Clitomachus. If he had ever been in actual communication with any
of the prominent Academics, Cicero· would not have failed to tell us, as
he does in the case of Antonius⁰, and Crassus⁷. lt is scarcely possible
that any direct intercourse between Philo and Catulus can have taken
place, although one passage in the lucullus seems to imply it⁸. Still
Philo had a brilliant reputation during the later years of Catulus, and
no one at all conversant with Greek literature or society could fail to
be well acquainted with his opinions⁹. No follower of Carneades and
Clitomachus, such as Catulus undoubtedly was¹⁰, could view with in-
difference the latest development of Academic doctrine. The famous
books of Philo were probably not known to Catulus¹¹.

I now proceed to draw from the references' tn the Lucullus the
chief features of the speech o fCatulus the younger. It was probably
introduced by a mention of Philo's books¹' . Some considerable portion
of the speech must have been directed against the innovatione made by
Philo upon the genuine Carneadean doctrine. These the elder Catulus
had repudiated with great warmth, even charging Philo with wilful mis·
