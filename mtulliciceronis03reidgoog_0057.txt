representation of the older Academias ¹. The most important part of
the speech, however, must have consisted in a defence of Carneades and
Arcesilas against the dogmatic schools¹. Catulus evidently concerned
himself more with the system of the later than with that of the earlier
teacher. It is also exceedingly probable that he touched only very
lightly on the negative Academic arguments, while he developed fully .
that positive teaching about the πιθανὸν which was so distinctive of
Carneades. All the counter arguments of Lucullus which concern the
destructive side of Academic teuching appear to be distinctly aimed
’ at Cicero, who must have represented it in the discourse of the day
before⁸. On the other hand, those parts of Lucullus' speech which deal
with the constructive part of Academicism⁴ seem to be intended for
CatuluS, to whom the maintenance of the genuine Carneadean distinc-
tion between ἄδηλα and ἀκατάληπτα would be a peculiarly congenial taslu
Thus the commendation bestowed by Lucullus on the way in which the
probabile had been handled appertains to Catulus. The exposition of
the sceptical criticism would naturally be reserved for the most brilliant
orator of the party-Cicero himself. These conjectures have the ad-

vantage of establishing an intimate connexion between the prooemium,
the speech of Catulus, and the succeeding speech of Hortensius. In the

prooemium the innovations of Philo were mentioned3 Catulus then v
showed that the only object aimed at by them, a satisfactory basis for
ἐπιστήμη, was already attained by the Carneadean theory of the atdavo‘v:
whereupon Hortensius showed, after the principles of Antiochus, that
such a basis was provided by the older philosophy, which both Car-
neades and Philo had wrongly abandoned. Thus Philo becomes the
central point or pivot of the discussion. With this arrangement none of
the indications in the Lumllus clash. Even the demand made by Hor-
tensius upon catulus⁶ need only imply such a bare statement on the
part of the latter of the negative Arcesilaean doctrines as would clear
the ground for the Carneadean πιθανόν. One important opinion main-
tained by Catulus after Carneades, that the wise man would opine⁸, aa.
would deliver himself of opinions, though he knew they tested on no
sure and certain foundations (τὸν σοφὰν δοξάσειν), seems another indica-
tion of the generally constructive character of his exposition Every-
thing points to the conclusion that this part of the dialogue was mainly
drawn by Cicero from the writings of Clitomachus.
