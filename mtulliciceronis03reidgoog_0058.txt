Catulus was followed by Hortensius, who in some way spoke in
favour ol Antiochean opinions, but to what extent is uncertain¹. 1
think it extremely probable that he gave a resume os the history ofphi·
losophy, corresponding to the speech os Varro in the beginning os the
Acodeoo'co Posteriora. One main reason in favour of this view is the
difficulty of understanding to whom, is not to Hortensius, the substance

os this speech could have been assigned in th'e first edition. In the ’

Academica Posteriora it was necessary to make Varro speak first and not
¹second as Hortensius did 5 this accounts for the disappearance in the
second edition ol a polemical argument advanced by Hortensius', which
would be appropriate only in the mouth os one who was answeringaspeech
already made. On the view I have taken, there would be little difficulty
in the fact that Hortensius now advocates a dogmatic philosophy,

, though in the lost dialogue which bore his name he had argued against

philosophy altogether³, and denied that philosophy and wisdom were at

’ Ι all the same thing⁴. Such a historica] re'sume as I have supposed Hor-

tensius ιο give would be within the reach os any cultivated man os the
tinae, and would only be put sorward to show that the New Academic
revolt against the old AcademicoPeripatetic school, as viewed by
Antiochus, was unjustifiable. There is actual narrant for stating that
the exposition given by Hortensius os Antiochus was merely superficial⁵.
We are thus relieved from the necessity of forcing the meaning of the
words Hortensium nostrum commouerr's‘‚ from which Krische infers that
the dialogue, entitled Hortensius, had ended in aconversion to philo-
sophy of the orator from whom it was named. To any such conversion
we have nowhere else any allusion.

The relation in which Hortensius stood to Cicero, also his character
and attainments', are too well known to need mention here. He seems
to have been as nearly innocent of any acquaintance with philosophy as
it was possible at the time for an educated man to be. Cicero’s
materials sor the speech os Hortensius were, doubtless‚ drawn from the
works of Antiochus⁷.

l

The speech of Hortensius was answered by Cicero himself. Is my ’

view of the preceding speech is correct, it follows that Cicero in his
reply pursued the same course which he takes in his answer to Varro,
partos which is preserved in the Academico Postertoro⁸. He justified
the N ew Academy by showing that it was in essentia] harmony with me
