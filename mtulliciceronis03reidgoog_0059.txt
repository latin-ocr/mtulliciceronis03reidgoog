Old, and also, in its views regarding the foundations of knowledge, with
those ancient philosophers who preceded Plato. Lucullus, therefore,
reproves him as a rebel in philosophy, who appeals to great and ancient ·

names like a seditious tribune¹. Unsair use had been made, according ·
to Lucullus, of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides, ⁴
Xenophanes, Plato, and Socrates². But Cicero did not merely given

historical summary. He must have dealt with the theory of κατα-

ληπτικὴ φαντασία and ἔννοιαι (which though really Stoic had been

adopted by Antiochus), since he found it necessary to ‘manufacture'

(sabrtlari) Latin terrns to represent the Greek⁸. He probably also

commented on the headlong rashness with which the dogmatists gave

their assent to the truth of phenomena To this a retortis made by

Lucullus⁴. That Cicero's criticism of the dogmatic schools was, in this

speech, incomplete and merely preliminary, may be seen by the fact that ’
he found no occasion to Latinise such terms as κατάληψις (i. e. in the
abstract, as opposed to the individual καταληπτικὴ φαντασία), ἐνάργεια,
ὁρμή, ἅποδείξις, δόγμα, οἰκεῖον, ἄδηλα, ἐποχή, nearly all important terms “
in the Stoic, and to some extent in the Antiochean system, all of ·

‘which Lucullus is obliged to translate for himself. The more the
matter is examined the more clearly does it appear that the main
purpose of Cicero in this sp'eech was to justify from the history of
philosophy the position of the New Academy, and not to advance
sceptical arguments against experience, which were reserved for his
answer to Lucullus. ln the later speech, he expressly tells us that such
sceptical paradoxes as were put forward by him in the first day’s dis-
course were really out of place, and were merely introduced in order to
disarm Lucullus, who was to spealc next⁶. Yet these arguments must
have occupied some considerable space in Cicero’s speech, although
foreign to its main intention ⁷. He probably gave a summary classifica-
tion of the sensations, with the reasons for refusing to assent to the truth ,
of each class⁸. The whole constitution aud tenor of the elaborate
speech of Cicero in the Lucullus proves that no general or minute
demonstration of the impossibility of ἐπιστήμη in the dogmatic sense
had been attempted in his statement of ¹the day before. Cicero’s argu·
ment in the Catulus was allowed by Lucullus to have considerably
damaged the cause of Antiochus⁹. The three speeches of Catulus,
