Hortensius, and Cicero had gone over nearly the whole ground marked
out for the discussion ¹, but only cursorily, so that there was plenty of
room for a more minute examination in the [uultus.

One question remains: how far did Cicero defend Philo against the
attack of Catulus? Krische (followed by Engstrand) believes that the
argument of Catulus was answered point by point. In this opinionI
cannot concur. Cicero never appears elsewhere as the defendet of Philo’s
reactionary doctrines'. The expressions of Lucullus seem to imply that
this part of his teaching had been dismissed by all the disputants⁸. It
follows that when Cicero, in his letter of dedication to Varro, describes
his own part as that of Philo ( partui mt'hi sumpsi Philam's⁴), he merely
attaches Philo's name to those general N ew Academic doctrines which
had been so brilliantly supported by the pupil of Clitomachus in his
earlier days The two chief sources for Cicero’s speech in the Catulus
were, as we shall see, Philo himself and Clitomachus

In that intermediate form of the Academica, where Cato and Bmtus
appeared in the place of Hortensius and Lucullus, there can be no
doubt that Brutus occupied a more prominent position than Cato.
Consequently Cato must have taken the comparatively inferior part of
Hortensius, while Brutus took that of Lucullus. It may perhaps seem
strange that a Stoic of the Stoics like Cato should be chosen to repre-
sent Antiochus, however much that philosopher may have borrowed
from Zeno. The rote given to Hortensius, however, was in my view
such as any cultivated man might sustain who had not definitely com-
mitted himself to sceptical principles. So eminent an Antiochean as
Brutus cannot have been reduced to the comparatively secondary posi-
tion assigned to Hortensius in the Academica Prrbra. He would natu-
rally occupy the place given to Varro in the second edition⁶. If this be
true, Brutus would not speak at length in the first hals of the work.
Cato is not closely enough connected with the Academica to render it
necessary to treat of him farther.
