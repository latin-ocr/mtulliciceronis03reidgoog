at Bauii¹. in the eveni'ng, ii the wind favoured, Lucullus was to leave
iorhis vilia at Neapolis, Cicero sor his at Pompeii¹. Bauli was a little
piace on the guitot Baiae, close to Cimmerium, round which many
legends lingered³. The scenery in view was magnificent⁴. As the party
were seated in the xystus with its polished floor and statues and shrubs,
the waves rippled at their feet, and the sea away to the horizon glistened
and quivered under the bright sun, and changed colour under tire fresh-
ening breeze. Within sight iay the shore at Cumae and Puteoli, thirty

Cicero strove as usual to give vividness to the dialogue and to keep
it perlectly free from anachronisms. Diodotus is spoken of as stiil living,
although when the words were written hehad been dead for so'me
years⁶. The surprise oi Hortensius, who is buta ieamer in philosophy,
at the wisdom of Lucullus, is very dramatici The many political and
private troubles which were pressing upon Cicero when he wrote the

work are kept carefuliy out oi sight. Stiii we can catch here and there '

traces of thoughts and pians which were actively employing the author's

mind at Astura. His intention to visit Tusculum has leit its mark on , '

the last section of the book, while in the last but one the Dc Fr‘vzr'bm,
the De Natura Deorum and other works are shadowed iorth⁸. In
another passage the design of the Tusculan Disputatr'ons, which was
carried out immediately aster the publication of the Academica and De
Friribus, is clearly to be seen⁹.

Hortensius and Catulus now sink to a secoudary position in the
conversation, which is resumed by Lucullus. His speech is especially
acknowiedged by Cicero to be drawn from the works oi Antiochus ¹⁰. .
