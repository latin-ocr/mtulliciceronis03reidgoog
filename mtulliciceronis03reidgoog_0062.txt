when he went to Asia was the poet Archias, and during the whole os
his residence in the East he sought to attach learned men to his person.
At Alexandria he was found in the company os Antiochus, Aristus,
¹ Heraclitus Tyrius, Tetrilius Rogus and the Selii, all men of philosophie
tastes¹. He is several times mentioned by Pliny in the Natural ffislary
as the patron os Greek artists. Yet, as we have already seen, Cicero
acknowledged in his letters to Atticus that Lucullus was no philosopher.
He has to be propped up, like Catulus, hythe authority oi another,
¹ person. All his arguments are explicitly stated to be derived from a
’ discussion in which he had heard Antiochus engage. The speech ol
Lucullus was, as I have said, mainly areply to that os Cicero in the
'¹ Catulus. Any closer examination of its contents must be postponed till
1 come to annotate its actual text. The same may be said of Cicero’s
answer.

In the intermediate sorm os the Academica, the speech of Lucullus
was no doubt transferred to Brutus, but as he has only such a slight
connexion with the work, I do not think it necessary to do much more
than call attention to the fact. Ι may, however, notice the close rela- ,
tionship in which Bmtus stood to the other persons with whom we have
had to deal. He was nephew of Cato, whose half-sister Servilia was
wife oi Lucullus⁹. Cato was tutor to Lucullus’ son, with Cicero fora
sort of adviser: while Hortensius had married a divorced wife of Cato.
All ol them were os the Senatorial party, and Cato and Brutus lived to
be present, with Cicero, during the war between Pompey and Caesar.
Brutus and Cicero were both friends of Antiochus and Aristus, whose
pupil Brutus was ⁸.

d. The Second Edr'tian.

When Cicero dedicated the Academica to Varro, very slight altera· l
tions were necessary in the scenery and other accessories os the piece.
Cicero had avilla close to the Cumaean villa of Catulus and almost within .
sight of Hortensius' villa at Bauli⁴. Varro's villa, at which the scene
was now laid, was close to the Lucrine lake⁸. With regard to the
seigneddate os the discourse‚ we may observe that at the very outset of
