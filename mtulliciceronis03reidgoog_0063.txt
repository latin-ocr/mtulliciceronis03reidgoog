the work it is shown to be not far distant from the actual time of oom-
position¹. Many allusions are made to recent events, such as the utter
overthrow of the Pompeian party, the death of Tullia'‚ and the publica-
tion of the Hortensius³. Between the date of Tullia's death and the
writing of the Academica, it can be shown that Varro, Cicero and Atticus
could not have met together at Cumae. Cicero therefore sor once
admits into his works an impossibility in fact. This impossibility would
at once occur to Varm, and Cicero anticipates his wonder in the letter
ofdedication⁴. ’

For the main facts of Yarro’s life the student must be referred
to the ordinary sources of information. A short account of the points
of contact between his life and that os Cicero, with a few words about
his philosophical opinions, are all that is needed here. The first mention
we have of Varro in any of Cicero's writiugs is in itself sufficient to show
his character and the impossibility of anything like friendship between
the two. Varro had done the orator some service in'the trying time
which carne before the exile. In writing to Atticus Cicero had eulogised

ι Varro; and in the letter to which I refer he begs Atticus to send Varro
the eulogy to read, adding ‘Mirabilr'ter moratus est, sr'cut nosti, ἑλικτὰ καὶ
οὐδέν“.’ All the references to Varro in the letters to Atticus are in the
same strain. Cicero had to be pressed to write Varro a letter of thanlrs
for supposed exertions in his behalf, during his exiret Several passages
show that Cicero refused to believe in Varro‘s zeal, as reported by
Atticus⁷. On Cicero’s return from exile, he and Varro remained in the ’
same semi-friendly state. About the year 54 rac, as wehave already

, seen, Atticus in vain urged his friend to dedicate some work to the great
polymath. After the fall of the Pompeian cause, when most of Cicero’s
friends were dead (Art. xvr. 11, 7), Cicero and Varro do seem to have
been drawn a little closer together. Eight letters, written mostly in the
year before the Academica was published, testify to this approximation⁸.
Still they are all cold, forced and artificial; very different from the
letters Cicero addressed tobis real intimates, such for instance aa
Sulpicius Caelius, Paetus Plancus, and Trebatius. They all show a
fear of giving offence to the harsh temper of Varro, and a humility
in presence of his vast learning which is by no means natural to
