50 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Cicero. Τιιε negotiations between Atticus and Cicero with respect
to the dedication of the second edition, as detailed already, prove
sufficiently that this slight increase in cordiality did not lead to
friendship¹.

The philosophical views of Varro oen be gathered with tolerable
accuracy from Augustine, who quotes considerably from the work of
Varro De Philosophia². Beyond doubt he was a follower of Antiochus
and the socalled Old Academy. How, by an elaborate and pedantic
process of exhaustion, he selected this school from among the 288
philosophies which he considered possible, may be read by the curicus
in Augustine. My notes on the Academica Posteriora will show that
there is no reason for accusing Cicero of having mistaken Varro’s
philosophical views. This supposition owes its currency to K. Ο.
Miller, who, from Stoic phrases in the De lingua Latina, concluded
that Varro had passed over to the Stoics before that work was written.
All that was Stoic in Varro came from Antiochus!

The exact specification of the changes in the arrangement of the

subject-matter, necessitated by the dedication to Varro, will be more ,

conveniently deferred till we corne to the fragments ol the second
edition preserved by Nonius and others Roughly speaking, the follow-
ing were the contents of the four books. Book I.: the historico-philo· ἢ
sophical exposition of Antiochus’ views, formerly given by Hortensius
now by Varro; then the historieal justification of the Philonian position,
which Cicero had given in the first edition as an answer to Hortensius⁴.
Book II.: an exposition by Cicero of Carneades' positive teaching, prac-
tically the sameas that given by Catulus in ed. 1.; to this was appended,
probably, that foretaste of the negative arguments against dogmatism,
which in ed. 1. had formed part of the answer made by Cicero to Hor-
· tensius. Book ΙΙΙ.; a speech of Varro in reply to Cicero, closely
corresponding to that of Lucullus in ed. 1. Book IV.: Cicero's ansam,
substantially the same as in ed. ι. Atticus must have been almosta ·
