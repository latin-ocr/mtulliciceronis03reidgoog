old editions the lamellas is marked throughout as Academicorum liber IV.
This is an entire mistake, which arose from a wrong view of Nonius'
quotations, which are always from the second edition, and can tellus
nothing about the constitution of the first. One other thing is worth
remark Halm (as many before him had done) places the Academica
Pra'ara before the Posteriora. This seems to me an unnatural arrange

ment, the subject-matter of the second edition is certainly prior,
logically‚ to that of the Lucullus.

ξ 5. On tlte Greek sources astho ‘Academica '.

It hasbeen stated above (p. 24) that the philosophical works of
Cicero were merely transcripts from the most approved Greek writings
on the subjects with which they deal. There is but little difficulty in
determining the Greek materials which were used in the construction of
the Academica. The arguments in favour os dogmatism are frequently
stated by Cicero to be wholly taken from his old teacher, Antiochus of
Ascalon¹. That Cicero did notrely on his own recollection of Antiochus’
lectores, but transcribed the opinions from a book or books by the master,
can be clearly proved, though the fact is nowhere definitely stated. The
historical review of Greek philosophy down to the time of Arcesilas,
, which Cicero puts into Varro's mouth in the Acadrrna'ca Posteriora, bears
in every line the stamp of direct and close translation. It is in fact a
brief dogmatic statement of the peculiar views of Antiochus, given
under cover of an historical retrospect. Tradition has not preserved to
us the name of any work to which this portion of the Academica may be
distinctly referred¹. That it was a well-recognised and authoritative
statement of Antiochns’ system, is clear from the close verbal agreement
of Varro’s speech with other passages in Cicero professedly drawn from
Antiochus, and also with the Antiochean fragments of Varro preserved

by Augustine⁸.
In the Acadmr'ca Priora Lucullus reproduces the criticisms of An·
tiochus upon the scepticism of the New Academy. Cicero makes Lu·
