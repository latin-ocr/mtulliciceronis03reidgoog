52 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

ment is only a literary device No one can read the speech of Lucullus
κ ’ without perceiving that Cicero wrote it with aGreek work lying open
before him, from which almost every sentence has been directly trans
ferred. This book was in all probability the Sosus, a dialogue in which
Antiochus attacked the views os his old teacher Philo¹. The terms in ’
which Cicero speaks of it show that it covered exactly the same ground
as the discussions which Lucullus professes to report. The Sosus was
probably divided into several books, one os them containinga purely
personal attack upon Philo, which Cicero passed over in writing the
Acadonr'ca'.
The sources of the sceptical arguments in the Academica are scarcely
less clear. A work os Philo, twice mentioned, though not by any definite
title⁸, supplied Cicero with the historica] justification of the New Academy
which, in the first edition, he opposed to the speech os Hortensius, and
in the second to that of Varro⁴. From the same work, in all probability,
came the historical references placed at the outset of Cicero’s speech in
the LmIIusk It is not quite so easy to trace to their origin the argu·
ments by which Cicero showed the delusive nature of sense-knowledge.
They were common-places of debate used by all philosophical sceptics
from Pyrrho to Sextus. It is more probable that they were here bor-
rowcd from Clitomachus than from any other writer⁶. The ‘four heads’
oi the sceptic argument, which Cicero in his later speech mentions in
close connexion with the criticism directed in his earlier speech against
the senses, are entirely in the style of Clitomachus⁷. The same book
undoubtedly supplied Cicero with the more elaborate criticism on the
bases of knowledge which he embodied in his second speeeh⁸. Tradition
has, however, only handed down to us the titles of a few os the four
hundred books which Clitomachus is said to have written, and no one
os these titles suits the circumstances of the present case.
Cicero next gives two extracts relating to the constructive side of
Carneades' philosophy, taken from two works os Clitomachus which
he names⁰. The rest os his speech in the Lucullus is devoted to an ex- p
hibition of the hopeless discord which the history of philosophy presents. 1¹¹⁴
