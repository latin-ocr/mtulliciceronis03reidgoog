INTRODUCTION. 53 ·

l conjecture that Cicero here depended mainly on a work ol Clitomachus
mentioned by Diogenes Laertius, which probably contained a critical
history of philosophy¹. ln the course ol his remarks Cicero us‘esa
small fragment of alost dialogue by Aristotle'. The only allusions to
other philosophers in the later part ol Cicero's speech in the Luculleas
are such as to confirm the supposition that it was almost wholly derived
from Clitomachus⁸. ,
Our analysis of the subject-matter os the Academica leads therefore
to the following conclusion It was composed os two long fragments ol
Antiochus taken from different works, two of Philo from the same
work, four of Clitomachus lrorn three or four different works. No
attempt was made to recast or rear-range the subiect-matter. Itis to
the last degree improbable that Cicero even condensed or made
omissions to any considerable extent. He merely set the fragments

in the framework ol the dialogue. The local scenery, the illustrations ’

from Roman history and the connecting links‚ constitute all that is due
to his own invention. So lar as philosophy is concemed, the passages
which Cicero supplies contain nothing which was not notorious and
well known to every man ol culture in his day. In estimating‚ there
fore, the philosophical value of the whole work, the reader rnust put
Cicero's personality almost entirely out ol sight, and look'beyond him
to Clitomachus, Philo and Antiochus. The only question personal to
Cicero which can arise touches his fidelity as a translator. Eew possess, ·
few have ever possessed, the peculiar learning which would entitle them
to pronounce an opinion on this subject Ι have already stated the
conclusions concerning it to which my studies have led me‘.

There is no ancient philosophica] work which ought to be of greater
interest to modern students ol philosophy, and particularly to English
students, than the Acaclcmica. The problem it discusses is being de·

f bated as vigorously in the philosophical schools today as it was in the

Ciceronian age. The question concerns the bases ol human knowledge
