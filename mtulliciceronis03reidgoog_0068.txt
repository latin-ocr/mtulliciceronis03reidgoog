-way the mode in which the ancients stated the problem‚ and the lines ¹
on which they proceeded in search of its solution.

From the earliest appearance os the term ἐπιστήμη in Greek specu-
lation, it carried with it the idea of fixity and indestructibility. To the
Greek mind, knowledge was something which did not admit of degree
A great part of the work done hythe predecessors of Plato had for its
result the demonstration that knowledge in the Greek signification of
the term could not be based solely on the infonnation supplied hythe
senses. By their attacks on the trustworthiness of the perceptions of

the senses, the ¹Physicists and Eleates and Plato himself stored up
results which formed in later times half the stock-in-trade of the
Sceptics and New Academica But all these earlier schools, and Aristotle
after them, held that the intellect was capable of purging the impressions
of sense from their impurium, and of arriving at certain arrd irrefragable
truth.

On the other hand the critical efforts of the Sophists‚ the Megarians,
the Eristics‚ and even the Cyrenaics¹‚ tended to prove that the intellect
could supply no sounder or surer foundation for knowledge than the
senses. It remained for Pyrrho of Elis to combine in one compre-
hensive and orderly scheme the somewhat confused criticisrn of the
earlier and the later schools, and to boldly pronounce that no such thing
as ἐπιστήμη, knowledge, is attainable by human faculties, but that we
must act upon φαινόμενα, which give a confused and false picture of the
realities lying behind them.

Nothing in the whole history of philosophy is more striking than the
small vitality which the theories of knowledge constructed by Plato and
Aristotle possessed in ancient times. Other parts of their systems con-
tinued to exert influence, but the sublime theory of ideas as conceiwed
by Plato, and the elaborate fabric of human knowledge as reared by
Aristotle, became practically obsolete within a generation or two of the
death os their authors. After the time of Zeno nearly all who main-
tained that certitude was within human reach appealed to the theory ζ
which he advanced. From this time forward all the disputants in the u
debate tacitly assumed that, if knowledge is to be found anywhere, it ¹
can be found only in experience Nothing at all like the modern idea ι
of ‘intuition' was recognised as a possible source of knowledge. Again‚ ¹
none of the disputants questioned the existence osa real world of 2
things lying behind the phenomenaof which we are conscious¹. These
