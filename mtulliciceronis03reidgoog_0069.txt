two assumptione greatly limit the scope os the ancient discussion as com-
pared with the modern. Τὴε problem was this: given aworld os ‘things
in themselves' existing independently oi human consciousness, given
also the impressions of sense as the sole ultimate source ol information
conceming that world, to what extent can these impressions be trusted?
The Epicureans boldly said that every impression ol sense is true and
trustworthy‚ and did not shrink lrorn some os the most absurd con-
sequences to which this principle led them, though they tried to escape
from others by seeble quibbling¹. Zeno, on the other hand, began by
acknowledging that the impressions oi sense must be divided into two
classes, the true and the salse, and proceeded to give a delinition of a
true impression A true impression, he said, enables the healthy
mind ‘to seiae on' the object, and to leel certain that the object has
been rightly apprehended. This irresistible convictiou is the sole
test os truth. Knowledge, which is certain and admits of no degrees,
must be built up on these ‘irresistible impressions' After the time
os Zeno, the whole controversy conceming the possibility of certitude
tumed as on 'a pivot upon the Stoic definition ol the individual
‘irresistible impression' (καταληπτικὴ φαντασία). It was assumed that
ir the definition could be invalidated, the edifice oi knowledge crumbled
away from its base.

The sceptic school ol Pyrrho practically died out with Timon oi
Phlius, and was ouly revived after Cicero's death'. But the mantle os
Pyrrho really lell on Arcesilas, the founder os the New Academic

school. He spent his life in combating the definition of the unit of .

knowledge given by the Stoics, and his scepticism was practically
indistinguishable lrorn that os Pyrrho. His position was modified by
Carneadea, whose negative criticism was as brilliant as that os Arcesilas,
but who introduced positive teachiug in the shape ol what may be
called a calculus ol probabilities. While Arcesilas held that the
moment we begin to examine any impression ol sense, we shall find
that the arguments sor and against its trustworthiness exactly balance
each other, Carneades thought that the scale would generally incline
decisively in one direction or the other, so that although certitude is
unattainable, various degrees of probability are within our resch
