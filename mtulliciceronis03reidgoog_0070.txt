Pyrrho and Arcesilas had maintained that all we can do is to act upon
’ phenomena without attempting to determine their truth or salsehood.
Carneades equally holding that certainty is a chimera, contended that
reason could lead up to sundry approximations to certainty, which were
the proper bases ior action.

The question whether action was possible without certainty was
much talked ol by the disputants, but the debate on this topic amounted
in essence to nothing but assertion and denial. The dogmatists affinned
that il the sceptics were consistent they would be reduced to inaction
of every description. The dogmatic position may be here stated iu the
words of Hume¹. ‘A Pyrrhonian-cannot expect that his philosophy
will have any constant influence, or if it had that its influence would be
beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must acknowledge, if he
will acknowledge anything, that all human life must perish‚ were his
principles universally and steadily to prevail. All discourse, all action
would immediately cease, and men remain in a total lethargy, till the,
necessities of nature, unsatisfied, put an end to their miserable existence.
lt is true so fatal an event is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always
too strong sor principle, and though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself
and others into a momentary confusion by his profound reasonings, the
first and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubts and
scruples and leave him the same in every point os action and specula-
tion with the philosophers oi every other sect, or with those who never
concemed themselves with any philosophica] arguments or researches!

The sceptics on the other hand maintained that there was no
inconsistency in their acting and speaking like other men, provided it
were understood that their speech or action was not to be taken as
implying a belief in the correctness os impressions. They entrenched
themselves in their impregnable position, which may also be described
by quoting Hume'. ‘By what argument can it be proved that the per-
ceptions os the mind must be caused by externa] objects entirely differ· ².
ent from them, though resembling theml... It is a question oi fact l
whether the perceptions os the senses be produced by extcmal objects l„
resembling them. How shall this question be determined? By experi- y
enee surely as all other questions ol a like nature. But here experience ἰ
isand must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to '
it but the perceptions and cannot possibly reach any experience of their i
connexion with objects. The supposition of such a connexion is there· ¹
iore without any foundation in reasoning.’
