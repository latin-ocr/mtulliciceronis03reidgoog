Hume and many other writers since have pronounced these sceptical
arguments to be unanswerable. Modern philosophers have in fact been
able to supply to the question ‘why should we believe any impression
of sense to give a correct picture of the object which causes it?' no
better answer than that of the Stoics ‘because in some cases our minds
feel convinced of the correctness ol the impression, in others not'

b. Philo and Antiochus.

The opinions of these philosophers will only here be discussed so
far as they concern the main problem of the Academica& Both Philo
and Antiochus began their teaching as ardent defenders of the pure
doctrine of Cameades'. Both in their later days promoted‚ in different
degrees‚ a reaction towards dogmatic doctrines. In the case of Antio·

chus this reaction was complete. So far as dialectic was concemed, he ”

wholly attached himself to the Stoic school. In ethics and nattual
science he also accepted much from Zeno and Chrysippus, while de·
claring that these philosophers had borrowed their teaching from Plato
and Aristotle and their immediate followers⁸. In Philo’s case the natine of
the reaction is exceedingly difficult to trace. All the information about
it which we possess consists of a few hints in the Academica and two or
three passages in other writers. Philo it is certain at all times maln-
tained in its full force the whole polemic conducted by Carneades
against the Stoic definition of the ‘irresistible impression⁴.' Yet he
contended that things are in their own nature knowable³. But noue of
the sceptics or New Academics had ever asserted that our lack of sure
knowledge is due to the nature of the objects of cognition. They re-
ferred it entirely to the defects in our faculties of perception. We want
to be told, therefore, ltozo Philo supposed it possible to arrive at a know·
ledge of things. Unfortunately no ancient authority has preserved for
us any information on this point, and we are reduced to founding con·
