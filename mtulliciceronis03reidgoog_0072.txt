jectures on indirect evidence ofa very sbadowy kind. The theory of
C. F. Hermann, that Philo returned to Plato’s doctrine of the ἴδιαι, is “
destitute of all probability¹. Zeller thinks that Philo merely restated
with greater emphasis the Carneadean theory of probability'. This he
concludes from a passage in the Academica which may refer to Philo
especially, though that is far from certain⁸. It is moreover difficult to
see why Philo should have been described as the founder or one of
the founders of a fourth Academy (in successiou to the Academies of
Plato, Arcesilas and Cameades⁴) unless he gave utterance to some
doctrine which was supposed to be novel. According to Cicero, when
Antiochus first became acquainted with Philo’s new views, he con·
fidently appealed to a philosopher well acquainted with the history
of the Academy, to say whether he had ever heard of such doctrines
being preached by any professed adherent of the school⁶. From
another passage of Cicero it appears that Philo, while he asserted that

· the Academic school had been perfectly consistent from first to last,

from the time of Plato to bis own‘, and while he treated the supposed
contrast between Old and N ew Academy as adelusion, yet endeavoured
to minimise the effect of the destructive criticism advanced by Arcesilas
and Carneades, and so to show that the history of the New Academy
had been generally misunderstood⁷. Hence he was openly charged with
lying‚ not only by Antiochus, but by Catulus the elder. That the ‘lie’
of Philo, about the nature of which there hasbeen much discussion, must
bave consisted in an attempt to put a new complexion on the sceptical
teaching of Arcesilas and Cameades‚ must be clear to any one who Ι
attentively considers the passages in which the ‘lie’ is mentioned⁸. In ¹.
all probability Philo argued that the solvent analysis which the New ·
Academic leaders applied to the Stoic criterion of truth did not express .
their own views, but was merely a Justifiabte polemical expedient. He '
