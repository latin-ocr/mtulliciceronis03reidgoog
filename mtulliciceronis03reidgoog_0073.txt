seems to have set up a contrast between the exoteric and the esoteric
doctrines of the New Academy, though his opponents asked in vain
what the latter were¹‚ and Clitomachus, the pupil and successor of
Carneades, declared that he had never been able to discover the real
opinion of his master concerning any topic whatever'.

Philo then assigned his own positive teaching, whatever it was, to
his predecessore in the school. Cicero nowhere in the Academica
directly defends his accurscy on this point, but he does indirectly try
to reestablish the impaired credit of his favourite master. Thus he
repeatedly implies that the unfavourable judgment pronounced upon
Philo was in great part caused by the failure of his critics to realise the
constructive doctrines of Carneades ⁸.

The most probable conjecture about Philo's own opinion is, I think,
this. He maintained that the impressions of sense give in the vast
majority of instances a correct picture of the objects which cause them.
We may therefore make confident assertions as to their truth‚ where we
see no reason to suspect their falsehood. Only, while we maybe sure that
in the overwhelmingly larger number of instances our judgment will be
right, yet in no one particular instance can we be absolutely certain that
it is so. This conjecture accords with Philo’s vindication of the serious
ness of Carneades’ assertion that the persectly wise man will feel free to
pronounce definite opinions though he knows he cannot absolutely
prove them⁴. We may suppose that this view agreed roughly with tbe
opinions of the Peripatetics at this time⁶. It would therefore seem a
substantia] concession to dogmatism⁶.

One thing which closely concems the Academica, but which is very
difficolt to determine, is the date at which Philo changed his opinions
The view of Brandis⁷ that the two books which excited the wrath of
Antiochus were written before Philo came to Rome, is exceedingly ,
improbable At the time when Cicero first heard his lectures, he almost
certainly taught nothing but the doctrine of Carneades. Now Philo’s
