60 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

arrival in Rome cannot well be placed earlier than the end of the year
82} act The elder Catulus, who is said to have reprehended Philo
for his change of opinion ¹, died a few months later during the proscrip-
tion of Marius and Cinna If the statement about Catulus is correct,
an extraordinarily small space of time is left for Philo's change of '
opinion to have become known. Yet that the ‘duo libri’ in which
Philo expressed his new views were composed at least as late as the
summer of 87 seems clear. They came into the hands of Antiochus
about the end of that year⁸, and had been in circulation at Rome only
a short time before he received them. It is possible that, in the public
lectures which Cicero heard, Philo gave expression only to that brilliant
negative criticism which he had inherited from Cameades‚ leaving re-
actionary doctrines for private conversation and his written books One
passage in the Academt'ca‘ seems indeed to imply that the views ex-
pressed in the books were new even to men who must have listened
to his oral teaching.

c Tae later Sceptr'cr'sna

We have seen that Pyrrho and Arcesilas were absolutely at one in
the methods they pursued‘. During all the vigorous and brilliant
period of the New Academy the titular sceptical school was in abeyance⁶‚
but the successive advances of the New Academic teachers towards
dogmatism⁷ called the ideas of Pyrrho into new life. Aenesidemus at
the beginning of the first century of the Christian era was the founder of
the renewed school of sceptics⁰. Its chief feature was the systematisa-
tion and reduction to order as well as the extension and development of
all the scattered arguments which earlier sceptics had used against the
dogmatista At first ten heads, called ‘methods' (τρόποι) were esta·

blished, under which were ranged all the sceptical contentions. These Ι

methods were afterwards reduced to five, and even to two. The work
