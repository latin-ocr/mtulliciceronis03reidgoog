INTRODUCTION. 61

of the new sceptic school is summed up in the extant ⁴writings of Sextus

3 Empiricus, who lived in the third century of our era¹. As the later
’ sceptics made full use of the literature of the New Academy, Sextus is

of prime importance for the elucidation of the Academica. He was an
admitted master of the sceptical philosophy, and his exposition of it is
thorough and relentless. It will be of use to set side by side the corn- ·
paratively loose assault made by Clitomachus upon the dogmatists, and
the far more highly organised attaclr which we find in Sextus For
this purpose, we will first take the ten ‘methods’ of Aenesidemus, and
show to what extent they bave their couuterparts inthe Academico,

The first ‘method'' shows that as animals are differently constituted ¹
the impressions which objects make on their senses must be different,
and therefore the evidence of sense is contradictory. This is only just
touched upon in the Academr'ca'. Nex't comes the ‘method’ which is

based on the differences of constitution found among human beings, in
respect both of the bodily and of the intellectual powers⁴. Under this
head falls that discordance of opinion among the dogmatists which has
supplied so many weapons for the sceptic armoury in all ages. A large
portion of the Academica is devoted to this subject⁸, while a few argu·

ments are also based on the physical diversities existing among meu⁶.
Thirdly, the sceptic urged that most objects make separate and even “

0 contradictory impressions on two or more of the semes, it is impossible

to say whether the object is possessed of one quality only, which is
differentiated by our semes, or whether it possesses just so many quali-
ties as our senses perceive, or whether it has other qualities which we
could not perceive without the addition of other seuses⁷. In the Aca· -
tlcmwa these arguments are only just hinted⁸. The fourth τρόπος is
derived from the difference of impression which the same object makes
on the senses under different bodily conditions, for example, in sickness
andin health⁹. This point is urged at some length in the portion of
the Academica which we possess, and probably had some space devoted
to it in the part which hasbeen lost¹⁰. The fifth ‘method' carries the
preceding contentiori a step farther and shows how the impressions
