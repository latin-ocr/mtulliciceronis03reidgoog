62 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

produced by objects vary when the subiect is placed under varying
conditions of space¹. This l'me of attack was so thoroughly hackneyed
that Cicero did not expend much trouble in pursuing it'. Sixthly, the
effect produced by variations in other external conditions besides those
of position was considered. Each sensation is affected by and mixed
up with other sensations, and these act aud react upon one another⁸.
This observation is not developed in the Academico, though it isinvolved
insevere] passages⁴. In the seveuth place, Sextus argues that different
quantities of the same material substance will make very different im-
pressions on the senseS, aud render it impossible to pronounce what the
real qualities of the substance are⁵. This contention received only
slight attention from Cicero⁶. The eighth sceptical method really sums
up in a general form all the other nine. It shows that all judgment
which follows on sensation is relative to or conditioned by either the
peculiarities of the individual subject, or the external circumstances by
which sensation is accompaniedt This principle in its general fonn is
nowhere exactly stated in the Academica. Nor are the two succeeding
τρόποι represented there. The ninth is based on the difference which
it makes to our judgment whether an object is of rare or frequent occur·
