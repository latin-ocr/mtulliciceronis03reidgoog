maining nine. The other three later τρόποι are logical tricks, directed
against the possibility of demonstration, no one of which is exactly
given in the Academico. The first shows that proof is impossible,
because to prove anything assumptions must be made, and these
assumptions require proof, and so on ad infinitum. The second meets
the claim of the dogmatist to have some unproved hypothesis admitted

as a basis of proof, by pointing out that the sceptic can easily propose
an unproved hypothesis destructive of that put forward on the other

side¹. The last ‘method' is the ‘medrod of altemation¹.' To dis·
tinguish a true from a false proof a criterion is needed, but to show
the criterion true a proof is needed and so the argument oscillates to
infinity between criterion and proof. These three ‘tropes'were no doubt
constructed out of ancient material. The first of the three can be
definitely traced back to Tim0n³, and involves (like the other two) a
difficulty felt with the first dawn of logic

The two ‘tropes' which Sextus attributes to some later sceptics
really constitute the horns of a dilemma, which showed that in every
instance where knowledge was asserted, one of two among the five
‘tropes’ might be used, viz. that based on the diversity of judgments,
and that which calls for proof upon proof to infinity⁴.

The eight socelled τρόποι of Aenesidemus stand on quite a different
footing from all the other schemes They bear the stamp of original
invention and have no counterparts in the speculation of earlier times.
They were directed to the overthrow of the Stoic theory of causes

Every editor of Cicero‘s philosophical works must at present depend

' largely upon the evidence conceming mss which is presented by Baiter

and Halm in their continuation of Orelli’s second edition of Cicero’s
works (Ziirich, 1861). The recension given of the Academico is by K.
Halm, who supplies all the readings of four uss for the Academica
Posteriora, and of three uss for the Academico Priora, along with
selected variants from other uss and from the early printed editions.

a. The uss of the Academico Posteriora. All the known uss of
this fragment are of dates later than the beginning of the xvth cent.
Those on which my text is founded are as follows. The marks here
assigned to them are those used in the critical notes.
