64 rua Acuoaurc's oo cicaro.

r. A. ¹ In the possession of S. Allen, Esq., of Dublin¹, who inherited
it from his father, H. Allen‚ Esq., well known to students of Cicero by
his Latinised name ‘Henricus Alanus! This us is a small quarto,
written on parchment with great care; few mistakes in it can be ascribed l
to the copyist. In parts the ink is rubbed away, but the forms of the
letters are so deeply impressed on the parchment that, with care, the
'readings can always be made out. The contents are-Academica Poste-
n'ora, De legebus, Donatum deorum, De divinitatibus, De soto, Timaeus, '
(De mundo), Somnium So'ptonis. At the end comes Acadonr'co J. with 1

' this title, ‘M Τ. Ciceronis fragmentorum de Academicis! It concludes ,
with the words ex Epicureo Zenone in ἓ 46, and has no proper subscrip· ,
tion, but merely the remark ‘non repeperitur (sie) plus! The us bears
the book—plote of the well-known Conrad von Uffenbach, who probably
'brought it from Italy¹. It afterwards became the property of Creuzer,
who used it in preparing his editions of the De legibus and De natura
deorum. The collation which Halm used was supplied to him by the
owner (‘ Henricus Alanus 'l himself, and is very rarely inaccurate or
incomplete. Only in a few instances have I been able to correct or
supplement it.

2. Al, Also the property of Mr Allen. This ms has not been
collated before so far as I know. It is a small folio, written in ltaly on ,
paper, and not older than the latter half of the xvth century. The us ζ.
(the writing of which is careless in many parts) contains only the Tuscu· '
lan Disputatious, and the first book of the Aeaeemoa Posteriora down to
et cum in θ 28, where it breaks off. What remains is evidently onlya ¹¹,
portion of a much larger us. Blank spaces are left where illuminated 2
letters stood in the original from which it was copied. On the ily-leaf is ,
written ‘from the Rev. John Mitford's sale⁸.'

3. Harl. 1. No. 3593 of the Harleian collection iri the British ,s
Museum. Written in Italy, on paper, towards the end of the xvth
century, with blank spaces for initial letters. The handwriting is small,
and the orthography on the whole good. The us contains only the De

' finr'bus and Academicos.

4. Harl. r. No. 6327 in the Harleian collection. Written on

paper 5 belongs to the very end of the xvth cent. or even to the begin-
’ ning of the xvrth. Contains both the Academico Priora and Posteriora.
A good many errors.

of this and No. a. possession.
