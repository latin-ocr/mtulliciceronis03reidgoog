η. V. In Paris. No. 7784; ‘olim in aede S. Victoris, num. 90!

In my critical notes Ι have given all the readings of these twelve uss
which are of any importance. The first eight Ι have collated myself.
For the readings of U l have had to depend on the collation given by
the Oxford editors of 1783, although I have found the information they
give about E and ψ so untrustworthy that 1 can put little saith in their
report of U. The readings of G P V Ι have taken from Halm'.

Of these uss no one, in my opinion, stands out as conspicuously

· better than the rest. Halm, and after him Baiter, and to a still greater

l degree C. F. W. Miiller, have attributed much importance to the ‘codex

ξ Gatianensis? I believe Ihave made it clear in my critical notes that
l this urs is largely interpolated and corrected by its copyist, who was
, Ι undoubtedlya good scholar. It may be affirmed with confidence that

all existing uss of Academica I are ultimately derived from a single
archetype. This archetype was, as I conjecture, not very much older
than its descendants, and was probably Italian by origin The follow-
ing passages, where all known uss agree, will be found to support these
conclusions⁸.

agree Ι denote the reading by Harl. Academica is concerned it is copied from
