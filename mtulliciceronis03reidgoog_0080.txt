Itis evidentfrom what has been stated that, although a good many
uss exist of Acad. I which have never been collated, or have been only
partially collated, any future examination of uss is not likely to contri-
bute much to the study of this portion of the work.

As regards the text of the fragments of the Academica Pastmbra, the
most important of which are preserved by Nonius, I have made careful
use of the edition of Nonius by Quicherat (Paris 1872).
