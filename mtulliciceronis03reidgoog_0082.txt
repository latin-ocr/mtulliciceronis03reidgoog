68 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

tur ego Wr'llr’neus Malmesburgensis more meo tic apposui quitquid de Ἴ
necteria et intentione eorum in beato Augustino inuenire potui, simulet lre'c

unaarta occasione notandum puto ne quis ene reprehendat quot libras genti- ³

liunr lego et scn'bo. Qui ent'rn nac intentione illos legit quia fastidit uel
uiliteudit divinas scripturas grauiter et penaliter peccat, unde et beatus
ieronimus se castigatum et ⁴caesuin perficetur in libro ad Eustochium de
diuinitate seruanda. Qui aero eos idco legit utri quid ornate et eloquenter
dieunt ipsein suis seriatis addit (sic) [here something has evidently

dropped out] et sanctorum eius gloriam oportune transferat teneres (sic) Ι

apastoli regulam ut oonnia probet quad bonurn est teneat ab omni spme nala
se abstineat nullomodo eum peccare dc lectione gentilium⁸librorum credi-
derim. Quod si michi non credetur, aaron eiusdem ceraunii ad oratorem
magnum urbis romae legatur! Then follows the well-known passage
from the third book os Augustine's Confessions, which tells how he
attributed his conversion to the reading of Cicero's Hortensius. This
is succeeded by the fragment os the Hortensius numbered 52 in
C. F. W. Miiller's edition, quoted from Augustine’s De trinitate.

The orthography of the res is in many respects good. The spelling
of Greek names in particular is better than in most uss

Of these nine MSS, I have collated 7, 8, 9 mysels. The readings os 1

6are taken from the Oxford edition of 1783 ; those os the rest from
Halm.

It has been supposed by many scholars that all existing uss os the
De natura deorum, De diurnatione, Timaeus, Dc fato, Topica, Paradoxon,
Luacllus and Dc legibus are traceable to a single original. The evidence

offered sor this conclusion does not satisfy me, but it would be out of ³

place to discuss it here. C. F. W. Miiller has elaborately examined
(Nem Jaaroucter, 1864, pp. 1²7 sq.; 261 sq.) the relation of the uss
above marked ABV to the archetype, but his conclusions are os little
value sor the study of the text os the Academica. Miiller attributes
importance to a us os the xth cent. at Munich, which still (sofar as I
know) remains uncollated.

c. In addition to the readings os the uss described above, 1 have

osten quoted those os the Roman printed edition oi 1471 which repre· Ι

scats, in the Academica Posteriora, a somewhat different recension os the
text from that contained in our nse. The readings oi this edition are
marked r. F uther, I have given in all important cases the readings
adopted by three recent editors, whose opinion on all matters connected
with Ciceronian criticism is entitled to a respectful hearing. These
are Halm (H in the critical notes), Baiter (B) who published in 1863
along with Kayser a complete text of Cicero, and C. F. W. Mtiller
