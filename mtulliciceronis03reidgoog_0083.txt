l (Μ), who is now engaged in editing Cicero sor the Teubner series of

' texts. The net result of my judgment upon the evidence is a text
which lies considerably nearer to the uss than that os all three editors
just mentioned. All of them, as I think ⁴my notes will show, have
altered many passages unnecessarily. This is chiefly due to the lact
that, good Latinists and eritics as they are, they fail at many points
from wantos a special study of the ancient sources for the philosophie
doctrines with which the Academica deals It is not possible sately to
construet a text sor any one of Cicero’s philosophieal writings from a
knowledge os latin alone, and least os all lor the Academica. Is I have
been able, as 1 think I have, to correct in a good many passages, on
grounds os Latin criticism alone, the judgments of these three editors,
the reason is that 1 have known the textos this book nearly by heart sor
many years, and have thus been enabled to bring to bear upon it at
once anything germane to it which has corne before me in the course os
prolonged reading largely directed to this special end.

d. I now proceedto mention some other matters more or less
closely connected with the textual criticism of the book.

r. In the library os the University os Cambridge there is a copy
os the edition ol Stephanus ol 1538, 1539, which once belonged to
P. Faber, and has annotations apparently in his handwriting ¹. Out os
respect sor Fabersname,1 have gone caresully through them, but find
nothing os any value in them. They as a rule either give the readings
of Lambinus, or references to passages in Greek and Latin authors.
Only in a sew instances do these written annotations disagree with those
printed by Faber, and they never add anything of importanee

2. The codices Ellenses quoted by Davies have long been a puzzle
to scholars. For most facts that are known concerning them Ι may
refer to Prol. J. B. Mayor's introduction to his edition of the Dc natura
deorum'. Davies speaks at different times os three codr'ces Elianses. One
ol these seerns to have been a real cudae, containing the lasculan Dis- '
putaturus only. The other two were not properly codices at all, but two
sets of various readings professing (it appears) to be drawn from two MSS,
and written in the margin of a eopy ol Stephanus' Cicero (1538—9).
Of these uss (ir they really existed) only one contained the Academica ’
Posteriora, while both contained the Lucullus. A careiul examination
