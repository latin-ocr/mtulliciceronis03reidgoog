’ of the quotations made by Davies shows these collations to have been
very imperfect. At least Davies often appeals to them on trivial matters
while he says nothing about them when dealing with difficult passages.
In his notes on Acori. I the codex Eluusis is quoted ten times only. In
only two os these places has it readings peculiar to itsels‚ via 5 2 ecquid
and 5 24 nou audt'tis sor uraudiu‘s, both evidently conjectures, the first
being right, the second wrong. In the notes to the Lucullus the ιντο
codices are indicated thirtycight times, but in such a careless way that it
is scarcely ever possible to draw distinctions between the ιντο. Only in
one place does he contrast two different readings oi the sarne passage
drawn frorn the two codices (5 27 where El. 2 has nonsatis, El. 1 sutis).
In another note (on5 129) he quotes ‘rus Eliensis’ in the singula13 all the
other references are to ‘omnes nostri’ or to ‘Eliens’ without distinction.
In one passage onlya reading is attributed to ‘Eliens' which is not
found in any otherus viz. ferrentur for serentur in 5 94, which, though
adopted by DavieS, is decidedly wrong.

Enough has been said to show that so far at, least as the Acadcuu'cu
is coucemed, the codeces Elicuses are not worthy of serious attention.

e. Conceming the history of criticism as applied to the Academica ¹.
Of the xvth century printed editions the only one os any use for the
study os the text is the Roman edition of 1471. To two scholars os the
succeeding century it was principally due that the Latin was purged of
the grossest and most superficial errors that had crept into the uss
The first os these was the Venetian‚ Paulus Manutius, whose edition

(1540—1546) first laid the foundation of a sound text os Cicero's works. ¹

He was succeeded by D. Lambinus, who outshone all his predecessors
in knowledge of Latin literature, and particularly os Cicero'. There
were sew weak points in the text on which he did not lay his finger.
But he had two great faults. In the first place he was not content to
try and find out what Cicero did write, but loved to introduce into the
text countless small alterations which he thought improvements, but
which were without evidence to support them. Also he destroyed in a l
great measure the value os his work by disingenuousness in attributing
his own conjectures to uss sources.

To Adrian Turnebus belongs the credit of being the first to advance
the interpretation oi the Academica by an appeal to the sources of the
ancient philosophy„ His commentary on Acad. I was published in

Paris in 1553. Thalos P. Faber on both books appeared in 1611, and
is remarkable for acute observations on the language of the work.
