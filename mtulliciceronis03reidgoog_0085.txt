The next editor who did much to advance the criticism ol the
Acarlemr‘ca was John Davies, President οἰ Queens’ College, Cambridge,
as a Latin scholar surpassed in his own time by Bentley alone. His
first edition appeared in 1725, his second in 1'736 ; the latter hasbeen
reprinted by Rath (Halle, 1806). Davies successfully studied in other
ancient works the philosophical doctrines discussed in the Academica.
The value os his work, great in itself, was enhanced hy reprints ol the
notes ol Victorius, Muretus, Lambinus, Faber and Turnebus, and other
scholars. ·

An edition by Wetzel (Brunswick, 1799) contains few notes, but
they are generally sensible That by Hiilsemanu (hlagdeburg1806)
has a good deal os useful illustrative matter.

It is unfortunately necessary to mention the edition of Goerenz
(Leipzig, 1810). The extraordinary vitality of this writer's works is a
singular fact in literary history. Before 1826 Goerenz had a reputation
sor Latin scholarship which was perhaps not inferior to that of any man
theu living. In that year, however, a small work¹ was published by
Madvig, then barely twenty-one years ol age, which shattered lor ever
’ the pretensions os Goerenz to the title oi scholar, in the eyes at least of
all those who are qualibed and who take pains enough to judge. Yet

a year later Orelli could found his text of the Academica upon the
‘praestantissima recmsrb' ol Goerenz, though he was well acquainted

with Madvig’s little book. Since then Madvig, in his editions ol the
Dc finibus, has most mercilessly displayed Goerenz as the dmnken
Helot os Latin scholarship. In spite ol this, the professed guides ol
studious youth, occasionally in Germany, but more often in England,
still to this day recommend the editions os Goerenz, even to the ex·
clusion ol all others.

The recension os Goerenz was the last which appeared, accompanied
by explanatory notes, until my first edition os 1874

Orelli’s critical edition (Ztirich, 1827) is still so usesul, that it deserves
a mention. It gives the readings of many os the earlier editions, and
although these are not always accurately reported, the information is
very acceptable, when access cannot be had to an extensive library.
Orelli has also reprinted, among other things, the Academico os P.
Valentia (mentioned below), and the work ol Angustiae, Aduersus
Academicos.

The most valuable translations are those ol Boost (Mannheim, 1816)
who was in many passages the first writer to see the true interpretation,
