in the notes, a great quantity of useful but illdigested matter¹.

Of the works on ancient philosophy earlier than our own time, the
Academica of Petrus Valentia (1596) is of sar the greatest importance for
the study of the Ciceronian Academica. This writer had acquireda
knowledge of the post-Aristotelian philosophy which remained unsur-
passed till recent days His work was reprinted by Durand (London,
1740) and by Orelli (1827, see above). A diligent use of P. Valentia
would have saved succeeding editors from innumerable errors. A worli
of the same class, though inferior in merit, is that of Castillon ‘Livres
Academiques de Ciceron’ (Berlin, 1779) which is accompanied by a
translation.

Of modern writers, Zeller surpasses in usefulness all others, although
it must be admitted that his accountof the post-Aristotelian philosophy ᾖ
is the weakest portion of his great work. , ’

All the works mentioned above have been constantly consulted by

My one aim in this respect has been, by combining and studying the π

existing evidence of all kinds, to arrive as nearly as possible at the ;

orthography which Cicero actually used. It would however have been
impossible, without encumbering the notes, to give, except in a few
instances, the reasons which have induced me to accept certain modes
of spelling, and to reject others. It is common in this country to find
all attempts at refonning Latin orthography opposed by the argument
from convenience. I am convinced that the spelling which rests on the
souudest scientific basis will in the end be found more convenient than
any other. Latin orthography, so far as printed texts are concemed, is
now in a state of absolute chaos. Something might indeed be said in
favour of a consistent conventional spelling to be applied to the whole
of Latin literature from first to last'. But scholars never have agreed and
never can agree on any conventional scheme, and were agreement
