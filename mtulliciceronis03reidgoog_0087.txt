possible, the loss would be greater than the gain. A thousand important
lessons in scholarship depend on the determination of the spelling used
at particular epochs and by different authors. The subject is however
too large to be pursued here. Ι would only point out one matter which
seems to me of the highest importance. The study of Latin inscriptions
gains in consequence every year. If the principle were always followed
of representing as nearly as possible the orthography actually employed
by each author, the student who passes from literature to inscriptions
would have as little as possible to unlearn. At present he must get rid
of a whole cargo of rubbish, which has not any antiquity to recommend

ir, since it is a burden for the most part cast upon scholarship by the ’

random etymology of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

In determining matters of spelling even the best uss are but in·
different guides. Cicero wh0, as Quintilian tells us¹, was most punc-
tilious in his attention to orthography, would be aghast at Halm's text
of the Lucullus produced by adherence to the Leyden and Vienna uss'.
The testimony of inscriptione, and of ancient writers who have touched
on orthography, used as it has been used by Corssen, Fleckeisen, Bram-
bach and others, is vastly more valuable. Yet the confirmatory evidence
of our uss is often of considerableimportance, For example, the
odious quum, to which many English scholars cling with such fondness,
is of the rarest possible occurrence even in the most corrupt of uss. A
student might work at uss for years without coming across a single
instance To take another example, the uss of Cicero, rightly con·
sidered, give strong support to the conclusion which is arrived at on
other grounds, that this author used -i only, not ·ii‚ in the genitive
singular of nouns whose nominatives end in -ius or -r'ura In the ages
when the scribes wrote the employment of wi was universal, and the
temptation to change the -i into -ii was therefore intensely strong. Yet
some of our uss preserve the original form ιιι as many cases as one in
five, a fact utterly incapable of explanation on the supposition that the
form used by Cicero was that m -ιϊ,

Ι have been at pains to point out here and there m my notes the Ι
true value of the conclusions to be drawn from russin matters of spell-
ing, because it has rarely as yet been duly appreciated. It is perhaps
hardly necessary to warn readers that my orthography does not pretend
to be certain or final. It only represents the best results my studies
have enabled me to attain.
