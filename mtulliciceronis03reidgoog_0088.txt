a. Academica Posteriora.

(ἕ ι-ι4. Prooemium. Cic. Varro and Atticus meet at Cumae (r). Cic.,after
adroitly reminding Varro that the promised dedication of the De lingua Latina is too
long delayed, tums the conversation towards philosophy, byasking Varro why he leaves
this subject untouched (a, 3). Varro thinks philosophy written in Latin carr serve no
useful purpose, aud points to the faifures of the Roman Epicureans (4-6). He
greatly believes in philosophy, but prefers to send his friends to Greece for it, while he
devotes himself to subjects which the Greeks have not treated (7, 8). Cic lauds this
devotion, but' demurs to the theory that philosophy written in Latin is useless. Latius

may surely imitate Greek philosophers as wellas Greek poets and orators. He gives ,

reasons why he should himself make the attempt, and instancing the success of Brutus,

again begs Varro to write on philosophy (9—12). Varro putting the request on one ³

side charges Cic with deserting the Old Academy for the New. Cic. defends him·
seif, and appeals to Philo for the statement that the New Academy is in harmony with
the Old. Varro refers to Antiochus as an authority on the other side. This leads to
aproposal on the part of Cic. to discuss thorougbly the difference between Antiochus
and Philo. Varro agrees, and promises an exposition of the principles of Antiochus
(13. ut·

§i 15-18. Part 1 of Varro’s exposition: Antiochus' view of the history of
Philosophy. Socrates rejected physics and made ethics supreme in philosophy (rs).
He bad no fixed tenete: his one doctrine being that wisdom consists in a consciousness
of ignorance. Moral exhortation was his task (16). Plato added to and enricbed the
teaching of his master; from him sprung two schools which abandoned the negative
position of Socrates and adopted definite tenete, yet remained in essential agreement
with one another—the Peripatetic aud the Academic (ry, 18).

§5 rp—r3. Part 11 of Varro’s exposition: Antiochus’ Ethr'cs. The threefold

division of philosophy into ἠθική, φυσική, hoyensi. Goodness implies obediende to r

nature: happiness the acquisition of natural advantages 'These are of three kinds,

mental, bodily, arrd external. The bodilyaredescribed (r9lt then the mental, which ¹

fall into two classes, congenital aad acquired, virtue being the chief of the acquired
(noir then the external, which form with the bodily advantages a kind of exercise·
ground for virtue (ar). The ethicai standard is then succinctly stated, in which virtue

' has chief part, arrd is capable iu itself of producing happiness, though not the greatest

happiness possible, which requires the possession of all three classes of advantages
(aa). With this ethical standard, it is possible to give an intelligent account of action
and duty (23).

ἔθη-49. Part 111 of Varro's exposition: Antiochus' Physr'rs. All that is
consists of force and matter, which are never actually found apert, though they are
thought of as separate. When force impresses form on the formless matter, it becomes
a formed entity (ποιόν τι or quale)—(r4). These formed entities are either primary or
secondury. Air, fire‚ water, earth are primaryr the two first havingan active, the two
last a passive function. Aristotle added a fifth primary substance (πό). Underlying
all formed entities is the formless matter ς matter and space are infinitely subdivisible
(η). Forcc nr form acts on the formloss matter arrd so produces the ordered universe,
