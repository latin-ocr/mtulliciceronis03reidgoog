outside which no matter exists. Reason pennmtes the universe and makes it eternal.
This Reason has various names-Soul ol' the Universe, Minu, Wisdom, Providence,
Fate, F ortune are only different titles ior the same thing (28, 29).

§i 30—32. Part lv oi Varro’s exposition: Antiochus' Logic. Although the old
Academias and Peripatetirs based knowledge on the senses, they did not place in the
senses the criterion oi truth, but in the mind, because it alone saw the permanently
real and true (30). The senses they thought heavy and clogged and unable to gain
knowledge oi such things as were either too small to come into the domain ο( sense,
or so changing and fleeting that no part of their being remained constant or even the
same, seeing that all parts were in a continuous llux. knowledge based only on sense
was tlxereiore mere opinion (31). Real knowledge only came through the reasonings
ol the mind3 hence they defined everything about which they argued, and also used
etymology, from which they drew prools. In these two processes consisted their
dialectic, to which they added persuasive rhetoric ( 31).

(ᾗ 33-42. Part v oi Varro’s exposition: the departures from the old Academico·
Peripatetic school. Aristotle crushed the ἰδέαι oi Plat0; Theophrastus weakened the
power ol virtue (33). Strato abandoned ethics lor physics3 Speusippus, Xenocrates,
Polemo, Crates, Crantor laithiully lxept the old tradition, to which Zeno and Arcesilas,
pupils oi Polemo, were both disloyal (34). Zeno maintained that nothing but virtue
could influence happiness, aud would allow the name good to nothing else ( 35). All
other things he divided into three classem some were in accordance with nature, some
at discord with nature, and some were neutral. To the first class he assigned a
positive value and called them preferred,· to the second a negative value and
called them rq'ecteti; to the third no value ,whatever—mere verbal alterations on
the old scheme (36, 33). Though the ternis right aciabu and sin belong only to virtue
and vice, he thought there was an appropriate action (ficiam) andan inappro·
priate, which concerned things preferred and things rejected (37). He made all
virtue reside in the reason, and considered not the practice hut the mere possession
os virtue to be the important thing, although the possession could not but lead to the
practice (38). All emotion he regardedasunnatural and immoral (38, 39). Inphysics
he discarded the filth clement, and believed lire to be the universal substance, while he
would not allow the existence ol anything incorporeal (39) ln dialectis, he analysed
sensation into two parts, an impulse from without, and a sucoeeding jadgment oi the
mind, in passing which the will was entirely free (4ο). Sensations (uiro) he divided
into the true and the untrue3 il the examination gone through hythe mind proved
ineiragably the truth oi a sensation he called it Knmtedgq ii otherwise, Igrmance
(⁴1)- Perccptiorx, thus defined, he regarded as morally neither right nor wrong, butas
the sole ultimate basis oi truth. Rsshness in giving assent to phenomena, and ull
other deiects in the application to them ol the reason, he thought could not coexist
with virtue and perfect wisdom (42).

§hs—end: Cicero's historical justification oi the New Academy. Arcesilas'
philosophy was due to no mere passion sor victory in argument, hut to the obscurity
ol phenomena, which had led the ancients to despair ol knowledge (44)· He
even abandoned the one tenet held by Socrates to be certain3 and maintained that
since arguments oi equul strength could be urged in favour ol' the truth or falsehood oi
phenomena, the proper morse to take was to suspend judgrneut entirely (45). His
views were really in harmony with those oi Plato, aud were carried on by Carneades

(46)·
