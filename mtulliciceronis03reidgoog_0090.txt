76 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

b. Academica Priora.

ἕ) r—ra. Prooemium. Lucullus, though an able and cultivated man, was absent
from Rome on public service too long during his earlier years to attain to glory in the
forum (1). He unexpectedly proved a great general. This was due to his untiring study
and his marvellous memory (a). He had to wait long for the reward of his merits as
a commender and civil administrator, and was allowed no triumph till just before my
consulship. What 1 owed to him in those troublous times Ι cannot now tell (3). He
was not merely a genera13 he was also a philosopher, having learned much from
Antiochus and read much for himself (4). Those enemies of Greek culture who think
aRoman noble ought not to know philosophy, must be referred to the examples of
Cato and Africanus (5). Others think that famous men should not be introduced
into dialogues of the kind. Are they then, when they meet, to be silent or to talk
about trifles? 1, in applying myself to philosophy, have neglected no public duty;
nor do 1 think me fame of illustrious citizens diminished, but enriched, by a repu-
tation for philosophical knowledge (6). Those who bold that the interlocutors in
these dialogues had no such knowledge as is attributed to them only prove that they
can make their envy reach beyond the grave. Some critics do not approve the
particular philosophy which 1 follow-the Academic. This is natural; but they must
know that Academicism puts no stop to inquiry (7). My school is free from the
fetters of dogrna; other schools are enslaved to authority (8). ‘ibe dogmatists say
they bow to the authority of the wisc man. How can they find out the wise man
without hearing all opinions? This subject was ducumed by myself, Catulus, Lu-
cullus, and Hortensius, the day after the discussion reported in the Catulus (9).
Catulus called on Lucullus to defend the doctrines of Antiochus. This Lucullus
believed himself able to do, although the doctrines had suffered in the discussion
of the day before (ιο). He spoke thus: At Alexandria 1 heard discussions between
Antiochus and Heraclitus Tyrius the pupil of Clitomachus and Philo. At that very
time the books mentioned by Catulus yesterday came into the hands of Antiochus,
who was so angry that he wrote a book against his old teaeher (rr, ra). I will
now give the substance of the disputes between Heraclitus and Antiochus, omitting
the remarks made by the latter against Philo (ια).

§5 134-18. Part 1 of Lucullus' exposition: false statements of the New Aca·
dcmics conoeming the history of philosophy. Cicero seems to me to have acted like
a seditious tribune, in appealing to famous old philosophers as supporters of scepticism
(13). Those very philosophers, with the exception of Empedocles, appear to me, if any·
thing, too dogmatic (14). Even if they were often in doubt, do you suppose that no
advance has been made during so many centurias by the investigations of so many
men of ability? Arcesilas was a rebel against a good philosophy, just as Ti. Gracchus
was a rebel against a good govemmcnt (15). Has nothing really been learned since
the time of Arcesilas? His opinions have had scanty though brilliant support (16).
Now many dogmatists think that no argument ought to be held with a sceptic, since
’ argument ean add nothing to the innate clearness of true sensations (ιγ). Most
however do allow of discussion with sceptics. Philo, in his innovations, was induced
to state falsehoods, and incurred all the evils he wished to avoid; his rejection of
Zeno's definition of the καταληπτικὴ φαντασία really led him back to that utter
scepticism from which he was fleeing. We then must either maintain Zeno’s defini·
tion or give in to tire sceptics (18).
