INTRODUCTION 77

mental, is the logical outcome of scepticism. lf the senses are healthy and unim-
paired, they give perfectly true information about external things. Not that 1 main·
tain the truth of every sensation3 Epicurus must see to that. Obstacles which
impede the action of the senses must always be removed3 in practice we always
do remove them where we ,can (19). What power the cultivated senses of painters
and musinians have! How keen is the sense of touch! (ao). After the perceptions
of sense come the equally clear perceptions of the mind, which are in a certain way
perceptions of sense, since they come through sense 3 these rise in complexity till
we arrive at definitione and ideas (ar). lf these ideas may possibly be false, then
logie, memory, and all kinds of arts are at once rendered impossible (aa). That true
perception is possible, is seen from moral action Who would act, if the things on
which he takes action might prove to be false? (23). How can wisdom be wisdom
if she has nothing certain to guide herl There must be some ground on which action
can proceed (24). Credence must be given to the phenomena which impel us to
action, otherwise action is impossible (a5). The doctrines of the New Academy
would put an eud to ull processes of reasoning. Tm fleeting and uncertain can
never be disoovered. Rational proof requires that something, once veiled, should
be brought to light (26). Syllogisms are by scepticism rendered useless3 philosophy
, too cannot exist unless her dogmas have a sure hosis (ay). Hence the Academica
have been urged to allow their dagano, that perception is impossible, to be a certain
perception of their minds. This, Carneades said, would be inconsistent, since the
very dognna excludes the supposition that there can be any true perception (28).
Antiochus declared that the Academics could not be held to be philosophers if they
had not even confidence in their one dogma (29).

ἐξ 3ο-36. Part 111 of Lucullus’ exposition: nature has formed men for the
attainment of certitude, and no substitute which the sceptics offer is of any nse.
With respect to physical science, we might urge that nature has constructed man
with great art. His rniud is naturally formed for the attainment of knowledge
(3ο). For this purpose the mind uses the senses, and so gradually arrives at virtue,

can be attained through the senses, throw the whole of life into confusion (31).
Some sceptics say ‘we cannot help it.‘ Others distinguish between the absolute

these rather lban with the former (3²)· Now they on the one hand profess lo distin·
guish between tru'e and false, and on the other hold that no absolutely certain method
for distinguishing between true and false is possible (33). This is absurd; a thing
cannot be known at all unless by such marks as can appertain to no other thing.
How can a thing be said to be ‘evidently white,' if the possibility remains that it
maybe really black? Again, how can a thing be ‘evident'at all if it may be after
all a mere phantom (34)1 There is no definite mark, say the sceptics, by which a¹
thing may be known. Their ‘probability’ then is mere random gaces-work (35).
‚Even if they only profess to decide after careful pondering of the circumstances, we
reply that a decision which is still possibly false is useless (36).

certitude is implied in the very fact of action. The distinction of an animal is to act.
Yon must either therefore deprive it of sensatior, or allow it to assent to phenomena
(37). Mind, memory, the arts and virtue itself, require a firm assent to be given to
some phenornena; he therefore who does away with assent does away with all aetion

in life (38, 39).
