§h 40-42. Part v of Lucullus' exposition: statement of the method pursued by
the Academics. The Academias have a regular method. They first give a general
definition of sensatior, and theu lay down the different classes of sensatione. Then
they put forward their two strong arguments3 (ι) things which produce sensatim
such as might have been produced iu the same form by other things, cannot be partly
capable of being perceived, partly not capable; (a) sensatim must be assumed to be
of the same form ifour faculties do not enable us to distinguish between them. 'lhen
they proceed: Sensatiens are some of thern true, others falsc3 the false cannot of
course be real percepimus, while the true are always of a form which the false may
assume. Now sensatione which are indistinguishable from false sensations cannot be
in some cases perceptione, in others not. 'lbere is therefore no sensation which is
also a perception (40). Two admissione, they say, are universally made, (r) false
sensations cannot be perceptione, (a) sensatione which are indistinguishable from false,
cannot be in some cases perceptions, in others not The following two assertiom
they strive to, prove: (r) sensations are in some cases true, in others false, (a) every
sensation which proceeds from a reality, has a form which it might have if it pro·
ceeded from no reality (41). To prove these propositions, they divide perceptions
into those which are sensatione, and those which are deduced from sensations; after
which they show that credit cannot be given to either class (μ). [The word ‘pen
ception' is used to mean ‘a certainly known sensauml]

ς) 43-45. Part vr of Lucullus’ expositionr preliminary criticism of the Aca·
demic method. The sceptics ought not to define, for (1) a definitiou cannot be a defini·
tion of two things, (a) if the definition is applicable only to oue thing, that thing must

becapable of being thoroughly known and distinguished from others (43). For the χ

purposes of reasoning their probabilcis not enough Reasoning can only proceed
upon certain premisses. Again to say that there are false sensations is to say that
there are true ones; you acknowledge therefore a differenoe, then you contradict

yourselves and say there is none (44). Let us discuss the matter further. 'ibe ’

innate clearness of uria, aided by reason, can lead to knowledge (45).

§5 46-53· Part vn of Lucullus’ exposition. The Academics owe their popularity
to the use of logical fallacies. The' rehrsnl of people to assent to the inmte clearness
of some phenomena (ἐνάργεια) is due to two causes: (ι) they do uot make a serious
endeavour to see the light by which these phenomena are surrounded ς (ι) their faith is
sbaken by sceptic paradoxas (46). The sceptics argue thus: you allow that mere phan-
tom-sensatione are often seen in dreams, why then do yon not allow what is easier,
that two sensations caused by two really existing things may be mistuken the one for
the other? (47). F umber, they urge that aphantom·sensation produces very often
the same effect as a real one. The dogmatists say they admit that mere phantom-sen·
satione do command assent. Why, say the Academias, should the dogmatista not
admit that these phantom-sensations command assent when they so closely resemble
real ones as to be indistinguishnble from them? (48). Antiochus attached these
arguments as sardas, and therefore faulty (49). The admission of a certain amount
of similarity between true and false sensations does not logically lead to the impos·
sihility of distinguishing between the true and the false (50). We contend that these
phantom-sensations lack that seli-evidence which we require before giving assent.
When we have wakened from the dream. we make light of the sensations we had
while in it (51). But, say our opponents, while they last our dreaming sensations
are as vivid as our waking ones This we deny (52). ‘But,’ say they, ‘you allow
that the wisc man in mndness withholds his assent! This proves nothing, for he
