vill do so in many other circumstances in 1110. All this talk about dreamers, mad·
rnen and drunkards is unworthy our attention (53).

§354—63. Part v11t 01 Lucullus' exposition. Final criticisms. The Academics
fail to see that such doctrines do away with all probability even. Their talk about
twins and seals is childish (54). They press into their service theold physieal
philosophers, though ordinarily none are so much ridiculed by 111010, (55). De-
mocritus may say that innumerable worlds exist in every particular similar to
ours, but 1 appeal to more cultivated physicists, who maintain that each thing has
its own peculiar marks (55, 56). The Servilii were distinguished from one another
by their friends, and Delian breeders 01 101111 could tell from the appearance of an
egg which hen had laid it (56, 57). We, however, do not much care whether we
are able to distinguish eggs from one another or not. Another thing that they say
is absurd, viz. that there may be distinction between individual sensations, but not be-
tween classes 01 sensations (58). Equally absurd are those ι[11011011100011001110·
turbed' sensations they profess to follow. The doctrine that true and false sensations
are indistinguishable logicalty leads to the unqualified ἑτοχὴ 01 Arcesilas (59). What
nonsense they talk about inquit-ing after the truth, and about the bad influence of
authorityt (60) Can you, Cicero, the panegyrist of philosophy, plunge us into more
than Cimmerion darkness? (61) By holding that knowledge is impossible, you
weaken the force of your famous declaration that you ‘knew all about’ Catiline.
Thus ended Lucullus, amid the continued wonder 01 Hortensius (60, 65). Then
Catulus said that he should not be surprised if the speech 01 Lucullus were to induce
me to change my view (65).

55 64-71. Ρο11 1 01 Cicero's exposition. Preliminary criticisms of the position
01 Antiochus. Cic. much moved thus begins: The strength of Lucullus' argument
’ has affected me much, yet 1 feel that it can be answered. First, however, 1 must
speak something 111111 concerns my character (64). l protest my entire sincerity in all
that 1 say, and would confirm it by an 00111, were that proper (65). lam apassionate
inquirer after truth, and on that very account hold it disgmceful to assent to what is
false. Ido not deny that 1 make slips; but we must deal with the sapr'ens, whose
characteristic it is never to err in giving his assent (66). Hear Arcesilas· argumente
11 thesapienr ever gives his assent, he will be obliged to opine ,· but he never will opine,
therefore he never will give his assent. The Stoics and Antiochus deny the first 01
these statements, on the ground that it is possible to distinguish between true and
false (67). Evenif it be so the mere habit 01 assenting is full 01 peril. Still, our
whole argument must tend to show that perception in the Stoic sense is impossible (68).
110110νο1, afew words first with Antiochus. When he was converted‚ what prooi
had he 01 the doctrine he had so long denied? (69) Some think he wished to found a
school called by his own name. Ῑ1 is more probable that he could no 100501 bear the ’
opposition of all other schools to the Academy (70). His conversion gave a splendid
opening 101 an argumentum ad hminem (71).

11011 accuse me 01 appealing to ancient 001000 like a revolutionist; yet Anaxagoras,
Democritus, and-Metrodorus, philosophers of the highest position, protest against
the truth of sense-knowledge, and deny the possibility 01 knowledge, altogether
(71, 75). Empedocles, Xenophanes, and Parmenides ull declaim against sense-know·

Socrates said he knew nothing but his own ignorance, while Plato pursued the same
theme in all his works (74). Now do yon see that 1 do not merely name, but take
