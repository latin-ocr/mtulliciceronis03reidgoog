80 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

lor rny modeis lamous men? Even Chrysippus stated many difficulties concerning
the senses and general experience. You say he solved them; even it he did, which
ido not believe, he admitted that it was not easy to escape being ensnared by them
(75). The Cyrenaica too held that they knew nothing about things externat to them·
salves (76).

ἐξ 76-78, Part 111 ol Cicero’s exposition. The issue between scepticisrn and
dogmatism defined. The sincerity ol Arcesilas may be seen thus (76). Zeno held ¹
strongly that the wisc man ought to keep clear from opinabar. Arcesilas agreed: but
this without knowledge was impossible. Knmoledge consists ol perceptions5 Arcesilas
therefore demanded a definition ol perception. This definition Arcesilas combated.
This is the controversy which has lasted to our time. Do away with opinion and
perception, and the ἐποχὴ of Arcesilas lollows at once (77, 78).

§3 79-90. Part tv ol Cicero's exposition. The uncertainty ol senseknowledge
demonstrated. Yon are wrong, Lucullus, in upholding your cause in spite ot' my argu·
ments yesterday against the senses. You are thus acting like the Epicureans, who
say that the inference only lrom the sensatior can be lalse, not the sensation itself
(79, 8ο). Iwish the god ol whom you spoke would ask me whether 1 wanted any·
thing more than sound sensas. He would have a bad time with me. For even 1
granting that our vision is correct, how marvellously circumscribed it isl But, say
you, wc desire no more. No, lanswer, you are like the mole, who desires not the
light because heisblind. Yet 1 would not so much reproach the god because my
vision is narrow, as because it deceives me (80, 81). ll you want something greater

than the bent oar, what can be greater than the sun? Still he seems to us a loot ·

broad, and Epicurus thinks he may be a little broader or narrower than he seems.
With all his enormous speed, too, he appears to us to stand still (82). The whole
question lies in a out-shell: ol lour propositions which prove my point only one is
disputed‚ viz. that every true sensation has side by side with it a salseone indistinguish·
able lrom it (83). A man who has mistaken P. lor Q. Geminus could have no insal-
lible mode ol recognising Cotta. h'ou say that no such indistinguishuble resemblances
exest. Never mind; they seem to exist and thatis enough. One mistaken sensation
will throw all the others into uncertainty (84). l'ou say everythtng belongs to its own
genem,- this 1 will not contest. Iam not concerned to show that two sensations are
absolutely similar; it is enough that human laculties cannot distinguish between them.
How about the impressions of signet-rings? (85) Can you lind a ring-merebant to
rival your chicken·rearer os Delos? But, you say, art aids the senses. So we cannot
see or hear without art, which so lew can havel What an idea this gives us oi the
art with which nature has constructed the sensas! (86) But about physics 1 will
speak afterwards. 1 am going now to advance against the senses arguments drawn
from Chrysippus himsell (87). k'ou said that the sensations ol dreamers, drunkards
and madmen were leebler than those oi the waking, the sober and the sane. The
cases ol Ennius and his Alcmaeon, ol your own relative Tuditanus, ol the Hercules ol

Euripides, disprove your point (88, 89). In their case at least ‘mind and eyes
agreed' lt is ol no use to talk about the saner momenta ol such people; the question
is, what was the nature of their sensations at the time they were ali'ected? (9ο)

§5 91—98. Part vol Cicero's exposition. Dialectic cannot lead up to certainty.
Dialectic cannot lead to stabla knowledge ; its processes are not applicable toa
large number ol philosophical questions (91). You value the art, but please re·
member that it gave rise to lallacies like the sorites, which you say is faulty (oa). ll
it is so, reluta it. The plan ol Chrysippus, to reirain fromanswering, will avail you
