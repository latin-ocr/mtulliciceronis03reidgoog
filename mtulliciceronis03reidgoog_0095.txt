really undoes itsels, as Penelope did her web; witness the mentiens (95). You assent
to arguments which are identical inform with the mensim, and yet reluse to assent
to it. Why so? (96) You demand that these sophisma should bc made exceptions to
the rules 91 Dialectic. You must go to a tribune 191 that exception. 1 just remind
you that Epicurus would not allow the very first postulate 91 your Dialectic (97). In
my opinion (and 1 learned Dialectic from Antiochus) the mmtiens and the arguments
identical with it in form must stand or 11111 together (98).

demic sapiens is not made 91 stone ; many things seem to him true ς yet be always seels
that there is a possibility ol their being salse. 'lhe Stoics themselves admit that the

and perception becomes impossible (101). lt is strange that our probabile does not
seem sufficient to you. Hear the account given by Clitomachus (191). Hecondemns
