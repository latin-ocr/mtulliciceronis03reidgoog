matie system like yours free from ι1111111101(114). Yon wish me to y'oin your school.
What arn 1 to do then with my dear friend Diodotus, who thinks so poorly of
Antiochus? Let us consider however what system not 1, but the sapiensis to adopt

’ 55 116-118. Part rx of Cicero’s exposition. ’1110 discord of philosophers on
physical questions. Of the three parts of philosophy take Physics tirst. Would your
raps'ens swear to the truth of any geometrica] result whatever? (116) Let us see

which one of actual physical systems the scpr'ens we are secking will select (117). He
must choose one teacher from among the conflicting schools of Τ111101,1111111111111111101,ι

Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, leucippus, 1)011100111111,Ε111110(100101, Hera·

clitus, Melissus, Plato and Pythagoras. The remaining teacbers, great men though '
they be, he must reject (118). Whatever system he selects he must know absolutely; ’

11 the Stoic, he must believe as strongly in the Stoic theology 11 he does in the sun·
light. If he holds this, Aristotle will pronounce him mad, you, however, Lucullus,
must defend the Stoics and spurn Aristotle‘from you, while you will not allow me
even to doubt (119). How much better to be free, as Ι am, and not compelled to
find an answer to all the riddles of the universal (110) Nothing can exist, say you,
apert from the deity. Strato, however, says he does not need the deity to construet
the universe. His mode of construction again differs from that of Democritus. 1
see some good in Strato; yet 1 will not assent absolutely either to his system 01 10
yours (111). All these matters lie far beyond our ken. We know nothing of the
human body, which we can (11110011 while we have not the advantage of being able to
dissect the constitution of things, or of the earth to see whether she is firmly fixed or
hovers in mid air (122). Xenophanes, Hicetas, Plato and Epicurus tell strange things
of the heavenly bodies. How much better to side with Socrates arrd Aristo, who
hold that nothing can be known about them l (113) Who knows the nature of mind?
Numberless opinions clash, 11 do those of Dicaearchus, Plato and xenocrates. Our
sapiens will be unable to decide (114). If you say it is better to ehoose any system
rather than none, Ichoose Democritus. Yon at once upbraid me for believing such
monstrous falsehoods (1²5l· The Stoics differ among themselves about physical sub·

jects ; why will they not allow me to differ from them? (116) Νο1 that 1 deprecate ,

the study of Physica 3 for moral good results from it (127). Our sapr'erar will be
delighted if he attains 1ο anything which seems to resemble truth. Before 1 proceed

10 Ethics, 1 note your wealrness in placing all perceptions on the same level. You
mtrst be prepared to asseverate no less strongly that the sun is eighteen times as large

11 the earth, than that yon statue is six feet high. When you admit that all things ’

can be perccived no more and no less clearly than the sine of the sun, Ι am almost
content (118).

99 129—141. Part x of Cioero’s exposition. The discord of philosophers on
ethical questions. What contentiori is there among philosophers about the ethical
standardl 1 pass by ruany abandoned systems like that of Herillus; but consider
the discrepancies between Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Euclides, Mene·
demus, Aristo, Pyrrho, Aristippus, Epicunrs, Callipho, Hieronymus, Diodorus, Polemo,

’ Antiochus, Carneades (rap-131). If 1 desire to follow the Stoics, Antiochus will

not allow me ς while if 1 follow Polemo, the Stoics are irate (131). 1 must be eareful
not to assent to the unknown, which is a dogma common to both you, Lucullus, and
myself (133). Zeno thinks virtue gives happiness. ‘Yea' says Antiochus, ‘but not

the greatest possible’ How am 1 to choose among such conflicting theorias? (134) .

Nor can 1 accept those points in which Antiochus and Zeno agree. For instance.
