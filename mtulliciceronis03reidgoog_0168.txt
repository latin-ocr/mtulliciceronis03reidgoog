not mean that κατάληψις was something
which had not the characteristics either
of knowledge or of ignorance, but merely
that it is the appointed path by whic
the transition from ignorance to know·
ledge must be made. Cf. Sext. A. M. 7,

ι, 94 φαίνεται τὸ μῆλον λεῖον εὑῶδες
γλυκὺ ξανθόν· ἄθηλον οὖν πότερόν ποτε
ταύτας advertatur ἔχει τὰς enarrarent
μονθτοιον μέν ἐστιν, παρὰ δὲ τήν διάφορον
κατασκευὴν τῶν αἰσθητηρίων διάφορον φοί·

τουσὶ τινες αὑτῶνι ib. 97 καὶ ἡμᾶς οὖν
ἐνδέχεται τὰς πέντε μόνας αἰσθήσεις ἔχον-
ται μόνον ἀντιλαμβάνεσθαι ἐκτῶν περὶ τὸ

of the Stoics was that although our senses
do not necessarily reveal to us the whole
nature of an external object, yet all that
they do reveal to usis true. The lan-
guage of Sextus has innumerable parallels
in the writings of modern philosophem:
cf. Mill on Hamilton p. ιο ed. 3 ‘the
impressione these realities (ie. external
objecta) make upon us we may know,
and these are all that we can know
respecting thern. In some future state
of existence it is conceivable that we
may know more, and more may be
known by intelligences superior to us.
Yet even this cau only be true in the
same sense in which a person with the
use of his eyes knows more than is known
