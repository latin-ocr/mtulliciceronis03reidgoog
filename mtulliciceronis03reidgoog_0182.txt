the third book.

Resides the actual fragments oi the meond edition, many indications ol its con-
tents are preserved in the work ol Augustine entitled Contra Academicos, which,
though written in support of dogmatic opinions, imitated throughout the second
edition ol the Academica ol Cic. No writings ol the Classical period had so gratu an
influence on the culture and opinions ol Augustine as the Academica and the lost
Hortensius. l ‘ve, partly from Krische, the scattered indications ol the contenis οΙ
the former whic are to be galbered from the bishop‘s works. In Aug. Contr. Ac. u.
14, 15, we have what appears to be a summary oi the lost part oi Book I to the
following effect. ΤΙιο New Academy must not be regarded as having revolted against
the Old; all that it did was to discuss that new doctrine os κατάληψις advanced by
Zeno. The doctrine os ἀκαταληψία though present to the minds oi the ancients had
never taken distinct shape, because it had met with no opposition. The Old Aeademy
was rather enriched than attacked by the Neu. Antiochus, in adopting Stoicism
under the name oi the Old Academy, made it appear that there was a strile between
it and the New. With Antiochus the historical exposition os Cic. must have ended.
From this portion os the first book, Aug. derived his opinion (Contra Ac. 11. 1) that
N ew Academicism was excursable from the necessities of the age in which it appeared.
Indications ol Book 11 in Aug. are source, but to it I refer Contra Ac. 1. 7 placuit
Ciceroni nostro beatum esse qui uerum inuestigat etiarn si ad cius inuentionern non
ualeat pemeniru also itia. 111. ιο illis (Academicis) placuit csse posse hominem
sopierucm, ettamen in hominene scientiam cadere non posse. These 1 refer to Cicero's
development of tbe probable in Book Il, although l ought to say that Krische p. 65
maintains that the substance oi Catulus' ex osition in the Ac. Priora was transferred
to Book IV ol the Ac. Posteriora. As tiis would leave very meagre material sor
Book 11, nothing indeed excepting the provisional proof ol the deceptiveness ol the
senses,1 cannot accede to his arrangement3 mine, Ι may remark, involves a much ι
smaller departure from the first edition. Allusions in Aug. to the attack on the senses
by Cic. in Book 11 arc difficolt to lix, as they apply equally well to the later attack
in Book IV. As to Books 111 and IV, I do not think it necessary here to rove
from Aug. the points oi agreement between them and the Lucullus, which will dud a
better place in my notes on the latter, but merely give the divergences which appear
from other sources. These are the translation ol σοφίσματα by cauillationcs in Luc. 75
(Seneca ep. ιιι), and the insertion in 118 ol esseruia as a translation ofolola.
