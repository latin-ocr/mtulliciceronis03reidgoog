¹5 Antiochi Heraclitus Tyrius, quiet Clitomachum multos annos
et Philonem audierat, homo sane in ista philosophia, quae nunc
prope dimissa reuocatur, probatus et nobilia, cum quo Antiochum
saepe disputantem audiebam, sed utrumque leniter. Et quidem
isti libri duo Philonis, de quibus heri dictum a Catulo est, tum
20 erant adlati Alexandriam tumque primum in Antiochi manus
uenerant: et homo natura lenissimus÷nihil enim poterat fieri
illo mitius—stomachari tamen coepit. Mirabar: nec enim um·

by scholam, but are indubitably right.
Though a man was, technically speaking,
only quaestor lor one year, and afterwards
pro quaestore by prorogation, yet the
popular language did not always main-
taiu tlte distinction. As Mommsen 10-
marlrs (Staatsrecht 1, 188] it is almost im·
possible in the case 01 most pro-quaestors
to determine whether they obtained the
title by grant 01 some imperator or by
actual prorogation from the senate. See
the examples quoted in his note. During
the greater part 01 the time 01 his service
under Sulla, Lucullus was probably not
even pro quaestore, but, strictly speaking,
legatus pro quaestore, i-e. nn officer nomi·
nated by Sulla, but enjoying the title and
privileges 01 a pro-quaestor. The provin·
cial governors appointed by Sulla held
office 101 unusunlly long peri0ds; thus
Sextius govemed Macedonia 101 eleven
years at least. It should be observed
that Cic. nuely, is ever, employed nomi·
natives like procoruul, propraetor, pro·
quaestor ,¹ thus pro conside, propraetore,

time a Latin word.
