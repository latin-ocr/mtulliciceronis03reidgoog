‘¹ Mr Reid is so well known to scholars as a commentator on Cicero that a new
work from him scarcely needs any commendation of ours. His edition of the speech
Pro Sulla is fully equal in merit to the volumes which he has already publishcd. ..
lt would be difficolt to speak too highly of the notes There could be no better way
of gaining an insight into the characteristics of Cicero’s style and the Latinity ol his
period thau by making a carcful study of this speech with the aid of Mr Reid's com·
mentary. .. blr Reid's intimate knowledge of the minutest details of scholarsbip
enables him to detect and explain the slightest points of distinction between the
usages of different authors and different periods. . . The notes are followed by a valu-
able appendix on the text, and another on points of orthography3 an excellent iader
brings the work to a close.”-Saturday Review.

‘⁶ Mr Reid's wide and prolound knowledge of his author’s diction renders him a
particularly sure guide to his meaning, and no intelligent student can read one of his
works without a material strengthening of his scholarship.. . It is not too much to
{ayhetprat the style 0er Reid's commentarios is now approaching perfection.’'-

“There is plenty of help for the tiro; but there are few indeed among adrenced
Ciceronian scholars who will not feel that there is manyacrumb for them,too, scattered
here and there in his instructive notes. The confidence with which Cioero's usage is
laid down, even upon comparatively trilling points, is warranted by the store of apt

. references always ready to bear out the rule. .. On the whole it is impossible to

desire a book more completely τετράγωνος, ἄνευ ψόγου rerwyutror.''-Acadcmy.

“Der Verfasser hat sich bereits durch seine kommenteirten Ausgaben einiger
philosophischer Schriften Ciceros, besonders der Academica, als griindlicher Kenncr
cicerontschen Sprachgebrauchs auch in Deutschland bekannt gemacht. Vorliegende
ylisshab‘ der Rede pro Sulla liefert einen neuen Beweis davon.'’-Bursiaa's Jahrcr·

‘⁴ lt is an admirable specimen of careful editing. An introduction tells us every·
thing we could wish to know about Archias, about Cicero’s connexion with him, about
the merits of the trial, and the enuineness of the speech. The text is well and care·
fully printed. The notes are ciear and scholar-like. No boy can master this little
volume without feeling that he has advanced a long step in scholarship.”-Academy.

“The best of them, to our mind, are ltlr Reid's two volumes containing the Pro
Archia Poeta and Pro Balbo of Cicero. The introductione, which deal with the cir·
cumstances of each s ech, giving also an analysis of its conteuts and a criticism of its
menits, are modelso clear and concise statement, at once intelligible to junior students
and useful for those who are more advanced.”--Guardian. ’

⁴¹ Mr Reid’s Orations lor Archias and for Balbus profess to keep in mind the train-
iug ol the student's eye for the finer and more delicate matters of scholarship no less
than lor the more obvious3 aud not only deal with the commonplace nota 'lab of a .
Latin oration as they serve the nceds of a commonplace student, but also point out the ¹
specialities of Cicero’s subject-matter and modes ol expression. ,. We are borum to l
recognize the pains devoted in the annotation of these two orations to the minute and ,
thorough study ol their Latinity, both in the ordinary notes and in the textual appen-
dices.”-Safurday Reatina.

·‘ Mr Reid’s Pro Balbo is marked by the same qualities as his edition of the Pro
Arrhiu.”—The Acadrmy.
